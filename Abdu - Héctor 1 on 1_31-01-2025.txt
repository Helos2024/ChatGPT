Hector Palacios:
Hello, Abdul. How are you doing?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello, Hector. How are you?

Hector Palacios:
Doing well, man. Yeah, I can hear you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Hector Palacios:
You're with the new laptop?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Can you feel it? Finally. Is it working fine?

Hector Palacios:
Yes, it's very good.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's also a compact one, small one. Good, good. Yeah, yeah.

Hector Palacios:
I think that we are spending good money on laptops. But it's because it's essential, you know? We need to have a good laptop and if we are presenting something in front of the customer, it's not a good idea that the stacks, you know, because people will think is working awful when it's a laptop in reality. So it needs to fly, it needs to fly.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
Okay man, so let me check just a few points that we have.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Hector Palacios:
Let me check if I have something that I owe you. Okay. Yes, I'll quickly check. So we have the the point with the laptop, we have the pre-assignment that is still on my site, scheduling a meeting on my site, whatever else is what you're doing, the laptop is fine. So we can close that one and go and see my VP.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So were you able to access your VP? Yes, I received a generic username and password from Omar and I use them to access the IBB add-on on Excel. Is that what we ask or another? Exactly.

Hector Palacios:
So on IBB, you will have two sites. It's a coin, basically. So on one side, you have Excel, and usually it's where the users are working the most. You have the typical planning sheets that you on every company or doing their internal planning and so on. The main difference is that here, when you have these very heavy files, because you have historical information from previous year, prior cycles, and so on.

 On IVP, that doesn't exist because everything is in the Cloud, so you get only what you need. If you want to check the data from the prior cycle, you bring that, but you don't need to have seen on one place is you strategically can download whatever you want. So goodbye heavy files, that's the point. You have now an easy file where you can download information and as it's Excel you can connect it to your other files and so on.

 So that is a great part. That is Excel and that is probably what you don't because because you install the Excel add-in. Now, you also have another part is called Fiori. That means flower on Italian, I think. It's the web platform that they are using. Created this platform and it's used on many applications. Between them is IVP. Basically, there also you can do many things. You can plant. For us, it's like part because you are doing the configuration there.

 So you are there, the models, the business access, you know, model configuration, planning jobs configuration, so recurrent tasks that you need to do, the run algorithms and in a recurrent basis, configure the algorithms for demand, inventory, supply, all of that is on the web. And for the user, the dashboards. Is what they want to see, like the analytics, the pie chart, the bars, the trends, all of that is right there.

 So usually they plan on Excel because Excel is fantastic, but then you go to the web and you have the charts with the information that you are using on the Excel. So those are the two sides, the web and the Excel.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
But well, you will have some training, I guess, got ours on that. Always, of course, we can expand. Take the opportunity on these sessions, man. Whenever you have a question, raise to me or tell me. I learned this and so and so and maybe I can like quickly think on, okay, but you can also have this and that, you know. So, let's try to open the doors to the discussions in that way, to what you seen on the GoTowers, you can come to me with questions or with what you saw and we can further develop there.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
Just two compliments. Yes, I just want to ask about this add-on. This view is the view for the user, for us.

Hector Palacios:
Can you share the screen?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yeah, this is an example of the planning view.

Hector Palacios:
You can have many. It's just one. Empanada. That's right. Who created this? This?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I don't know. That's so funny, man.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Empanada.

Hector Palacios:
Ah, so you are using Martin user. I'm checking because on the template you can see the the name of the user martin is a friend of mine and he has one generic user but I also share one with you let me look on the chat martin yeah martin I share one with you man this is the user there is a more generic one let me check okay I find amazing that you can write the two alphabets. So you have your alphabet and then you are able to understand another complete new alphabet.

 I find that amazing, man.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This is Arabic.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I know. But for me, it's like seeing Chinese letters, you know, I see it. I don't understand a shit. But you are, for example, checking the letters or the Greek alphabet or I don't know which alphabet is the Latin alphabet, I guess. And you are able to understand every word.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
That's amazing. Yes. You know, the letter is different if it's on the first of the word or in the minute or at the end.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So the same letter has three three shapes in arabic you're saying in arabic yes so depending on what's each one is when you have a different meaning no not different meaning but the same letter have shapes if it's it's the first letter in the word have a shape if it's in in the middle have another shape if okay like OK, you're saying like capital letters, but you have three instead of two.

Hector Palacios:
Yes, three. Wow.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
More complicated.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes. Wow.

Hector Palacios:
I remember that one time after getting out of college, it took me a while to get a job because in that moment, Chile wasn't the best place to find a job as a beginner. And also I I didn't have my title yet. I finished college, you know, but I didn't I didn't get the diploma. So I wasn't an engineer. And companies, they knew, OK, this guy is really bad. You don't have the title. And they didn't want to hire me.

 They preferred to hire someone that already had this title. And that was because my teacher, the one that needed to review my thesis work for very very sick. He was ill from the column because he get on the like on vertebra and on the spine he get like one how to say it it's not a tumor but these things that you have in the middle between the the spine and he got surgery and he was on bed like six months oh so he couldn't review my thesis and I was like hey I'm toast that I need to get this, but my teacher is like that, so I cannot push for this.

 And it was like one year without finding a job. In that time, that time I wanted to learn Chinese. You know, I thought, OK, China is the next USA. So Chinese is going to be a very, very important language in the future. That was my way of thinking in that moment. And I I became like really fascinated by the letters, but I at the end, I I stop, you know, that is interesting. You are now nothing. I don't remember.

 I don't remember. I was learning by myself as well, like looking on the Internet and getting some information and so on. But then I lost interest on that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Oh, OK.

Hector Palacios:
because you know English and you can communicate with any person in the world. But yes, it's interesting to know many languages.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Do you speak any other language aside of English, Arabic? At the last three years in my school, I studied German. But for three years on just for three years and I started to learn Spanish after I got the offer from Go. That's great.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
One month ago.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I can teach you some Spanish words.

Hector Palacios:
Okay. You're speaking like the most, if you learn Spanish, it's like probably you can speak 90% of the world, probably. Because there's so many countries that speak it. Because, you know, Chinese, many people, but just one country. So it's kind of the same. But Spanish, like Arabic, are very wild, white languages in the sense that you have many, many countries that speak the same language. So here you have the whole of America, outside of Brazil, that is very similar, Portuguese and Spanish.

 But you have South America, Central America, Mexico and then you have here Spain and even there is Guinea Equatorial. I don't know how to say it in English but there is an African country that also speaks Spanish.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Spanish?

Hector Palacios:
Congo? No, it's called... I don't know how to say it in English but in Spanish it's something like that. Let me check, I will find it very quickly. Well, Equatorial Guinea, something like this.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, Guinea.

Hector Palacios:
Guinea, okay. So yeah, that one. They also speak Spanish. Very weird accent, but yes, it's funny.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's funny to find that even in Africa, you have a country that is speaking Spanish. Yes. Also, in Africa, French is common.

Hector Palacios:
Yes, I was working on my last project, was on a company called GB Foods. It means white chicken, indeed, white chicken. So it's a food Spain, Barcelona, and they expanded. They are in Europe and they are also in Africa. So I worked with many people in Africa for three countries. That was Ghana. So I did travel to Ghana, indeed. I went. That's the only country I visit for Africa. It's not that easy to go there because you need to you have visa and so on and sometimes security as well is not the best so not too many countries they are sending us um and then you have nigeria

Abdurahman Hamdy:
so I also work with them in algeria and on algeria they they are an ex-colony from france oh yes so they speak french yes you know they have they have and a new language like mixing Arabic with French and this is a new language well then yeah yes when when in the news uh someone from Algeria is talking uh in Arabic channel they have subtitles under under what he's saying because we Arabs don't don't understand them because they are they are speaking uh really like a new language it's a new language yes that happened also morocco okay also for them yes for them we we can't understand them but do they do they speak french as well or

Hector Palacios:
like uh what what you're french not not pure french yeah But it's the same then. It's the same then for Algeria. They also speak French because maybe they were a colony from France? Yes. Okay, do you know? That also happens on Haiti. Haiti is one country on Central America. It's one of the Caribbean countries. And they are very, very poor. And they were a French colony. So you have two that are basically an island.

 So you have Republica Dominicana or Dominican Republic, something like that on English maybe. And then you have Haiti. And they are dividing the island in half. And both, one was a colony from France, Haiti, and Republica Dominicana, they were from Spain, okay? So the problem was that in Haiti, There were probably many slaves from Africa, of course, right? We are talking about those times. And they got these people there on that country, and that was a colony.

 And they freed themselves on IT. But this was people from Africa, and they were used to live there. And then now you have these people on an island but they are not basically a civilization. And they exhausted the resources from the island very soon, very, very soon. And they became very, very poor. So they're one of the poorest countries on America, by far. The other half, they continue with the colony on Spain.

 And with the time, then they get the independence. Other countries on america and if you see the reality of the island when you see to the right it's like green beautiful and you see to the left and it's uh it's like a desert it's crazy so you can see the border is and the difference is clear and uh I p and and well and the point is that in it they also work they also speak a very weird language that is a mix of the african roots that they have with the French as well.

 So they are also have a popuria, like a weird mixture of what is a French language.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
Very interesting. Yeah. So you are a language guy.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I didn't know. Not good. I want to learn. I am in the beginning to learn Spanish. I will be happy if I continue.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, let's hope.

Hector Palacios:
Let's see. Let's see, man.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
You know what is special about Arabic? That the Arabic is not just a language for a function. It's for feeling. So you can found similar words. You think that this word is the same meaning, but they are not same meaning. They are with a little difference. So you can found about 100 words. Uh uh with the meaning of love wow yes and and there is a difference between each one and how you get the difference is like a very subtle pronunciation yes but this is not not the topic this is the the roots of the language yes if you if you search for uh in like in the dictionary and the difference between the words, you will find an illustration.

 This word means when you illustrate a situation, what is happening in this situation, so this is the word meaning. And the other, what's happening in other situations. So you can imagine that this is love and this is love but this is in situation and this is in another situation and this is with the different feelings like this well so it's like um it's like the the

Hector Palacios:
because you you know when you have contextual language is that you can have exactly the same word but depending on the situation it's going to mean this or that So it depends on the scenario, right? So it's exactly the same word. Supposedly, the meaning is changing by the situation. Here's the other way around. You have different words for the same, right? Yes, but also... It's the other way around.

 It's the opposite. It's the opposite. So for every context, basically you have the same word. Is meaning the same, but you apply a word depending on the context A or B.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Ah, okay.

Hector Palacios:
No, it is what I tried to understand from you, you know, if that is the case. So you have exactly the same meaning, but for situation A you use word A and for situation B you use another one.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Another one, yes. Different words, a lot of vocabulary. A lot of vocabulary that you can't count and it's a fruitful language. Wow, it needs to be very complicated then. Yes, but this is also not the spoken Arabic. And this is, this is the old, the old Arabic.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Oh, yeah.

Hector Palacios:
You know that something similar and interesting as well is on the kanjis on China, on Japan, that depending on the like, the kanji means a word as well, but it sort of have like subtle meanings. Aside so they use a lot on the names because for example you have a kanji and you mix with additional scenes and you can uh create a name for example but this part of the kanji means love and the other one makes another thing so it's like a subtle meaning in the in the same in the in the same words so it's not what you're reading but also so if you interpret the the kanjis you can get another thing from this like a a second You know?

 Ah, okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So it's more complex to what we have on Spanish for sure. Yes, yes. I think language like the English is a functional language.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, for sure.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So you have, you will, like if an engineer is talking like this, you have a direct message, and the message is clear. But when the language is more complicated, one message can have different meanings. Also, not like a function, it's like or what I can say. When you read a novel or you read a story, the language is different when you read a reference. Yeah, for sure.

Hector Palacios:
There are many things that if you translate from one language to another, you are losing a lot of meaning.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, yes, of course.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, that happens a lot. For example, when I was young, I really was into animes and things that you have in Japan, you know? And when I was reading, because I was reading like kind of a comic that they call manga, that is basically...

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I know this.

Hector Palacios:
Okay. So I was reading one piece that is a very, very international manga and very in Japan very very and and there is always like a subtitle and they are people that is translating but then they also put like additional message you know uh they also try to say this on the meaning of that and that you know because they they try to translate uh also they like the second meaning of that because otherwise if you if you read it like literal uh you are going to lose part part of the context of what is the the author is trying to say yes oh yeah man let me tell me tell you a little bit about me so I think that we we haven't talked properly and so just for you to know I'm chilean you know I'm not from spain yes but you are now in spain right yes I'm living in madrid on the capital uh I now I have the citizenship also in spain but I'm from chile so I'm chilean I'm 34 close to certified on april I will be certified now um I'm the oldest son I have two sisters one is like 28 years old and the other one is like 17 it's like half my age very different yes so both my parents they are married they are alive so I'm very lucky um and well um so what else your sisters are with you in spain no no I I'm the only one so I I was working on spain on chile you know for goetia um and then I we got the opportunity because we started getting breaks here and I can for some years.

 Usually I was thinking at the beginning like one year, you know, and then I thought, okay, but if I stay one year more, I can get the citizenship. So I did that. And now I'm going for the third, but I think that it's going to be probably the last one because I also want to go back to see my family. No, I also think that as I'm, I must in Spanish right now, that those doors for me are open. So I think that I can go back and come to Spain and then go to Chile again.

 So it's a matter for me to decide what is the best on the on the moment. But eventually I will go back because so one, I miss my family and my parents are getting old as well. So I want to be there to take care of them, you know. Yeah. So well, what else? I didn't study industrial engineering. I'm a mechanical engineer. I studied that in college, not because I was like very passionate about it. The only thing is that I think like many engineers, we are like that, guys that like numbers, you know.

 I also like physics. And well, that was like a very obvious option in that moment. But I could have studied many things, I guess. Because all the engineer careers are related to physics, to science, basically, and mathematics. And while I studied that, I also did a master on that, on mechanical engineering, you know, even a master on that. And then I changed, it's like, it's like crazy, because you would sort of, okay, if a guy is doing a master on this, it's because you really like that.

 But the master is like a post, degree, let's say. And this was related to like computational mechanics. So I was doing a lot of programming there. And I really like that. I really like the numbers, programming, things like that. And then when I got out of college, I got this opportunity in OSCM. So they were posting some job opportunity and I was on English and, okay, they told me that you're going to travel a lot across America and things like that.

 And I thought, okay, this is a really, really great opportunity. I will not get it, but I will try. And, and I got it. I met Felipe when we were like very few people here on, there in Chile. He was just starting West GM as a startup, basically. I mean, it already existed, but the Chile part is a new one, like now in Egypt, maybe. But on Chile, we were on our own. So it was Felipe and us. And I think that I did well on the interview, so I got hired.

 And yeah, I started in this world completely different than what I studied, but I really liked it. I really like the idea of the numbers, the optimizing on the supply chain network and I really love it because it's really close to what I like to do as well. So yeah, I spent many years on Chile like four, five probably working directly there and projects and growing. In the middle I met my wife. So like five years ago I met my wife Chile while I was working.

 And then we got married and then we came here to Spain to live. We are just me and her. And yeah, that's about it. I've been doing this these projects many years and many and many places. You know, I when I just got when I just got to go see him, I traveled to Argentina. So it was true. What they were telling me. I said, OK, this is like the typical things that they are going to tell you so they can get your interest and then you get into the job.

 But as soon as I entered the company, I started traveling and I went to Argentina because we had the break there, Mexico and many countries there. So I was really fascinated with the job. It was my first time traveling as well. To this country.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
For Argentina, was your first time to travel?

Hector Palacios:
Doing work, yes. Before I was traveling to Bolivia, Peru, that are like also neighbor countries, but when I was studying. And then I, the first time that I traveled by plane was to Argentina and it was by work because of the work. Before I was traveling only on bus, you know, I wasn't earning good money. And yeah, it wasn't just that. So, yeah, so that that's all me. What also is can be particular for me is I'm vegetarian.

 So when I was on course, yeah. So I got some some free time. And I also when I was a child, I really was into animals. So I was, I was owner of many, many pets. So I had dogs, cats, birds, turtles, rabbits. Yeah. Yes. It was crazy about it. And my, my, my dad, my mom, they support me with that. So I was always having animals. And I wanted to be a vegetarian when I was a child, but my mom didn't let me.

 So she told me, I, not going to to cook for you uh vegetarian meals you need to have like you know nutrients and none of that so I stopped with that and then in college I decided to to get a chance and 10 years later I'm still a vegetarian so that's why I also like food like Middle East food because you have a lot of yeah because you you know you when when I go to Abu Dhabi, for example, because of Adnok, there are always many, many options for me.

 Because the food is rich in that Indian food as well.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And this soup is a meat soup. It's OK or not OK?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which one?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
In Egypt, we have a lot of vegetarian food, but this food is cooked with a soup, like chicken soup or meat soup.

Hector Palacios:
No, it's not OK for me. I'm not a vegan. I'm not a vegan. But yes, I try to avoid whatever is like, I was a vegan in one moment. I got to that. The problem is when you have enough free time to think about it, you can find enough reasons to do something. And I did it. And but then I stopped because it's really, really difficult, really, really difficult. So I need to become more practical about it.

 Like the first meal, so I was a vegan, you know? And then I go to my first meal with the company, with Felipe and many guys at work at that time. I see the menu, nothing vegan, nothing. And I was just hired. And I thought, okay, I cannot be like the vegan guy that is going to do travels every time that we are going to eat so I decided to ask for something vegetarian and from that from from that moment on

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I was vegetarian as I am.

Hector Palacios:
I'm still complicated for some people I guess but with the time I have more and more options so usually it's not it's not an issue and what else I also I'm a term So when I was a child, like 12 years old, I really like they made me learn a song on flute on the instrument, you know, in a basic flute. And I learned and I liked it. And I had a cousin that was very good at it. So he he taught me and I continue.

 I continue. Then I started playing a little bit piano, you know, but I left that. Very nice. And also like a xylophone something like it's similar to a piano but you play it with a stick so I was doing that when I was in school and then I learned to play guitar and I stayed with the guitar so from the 16 years old now I'm 34 I've been playing guitar like most of like half Yes, very nice. So that's my hobby.

 I'm not an electric guitar. I had one at the beginning, but I was much more into playing guitar and singing as well. So I have. So I do both things. Usually when you it's like you are one or the other, you know, there are like amazing people that would do both. Like Prince, you know, Prince was like a expert, like very professional guitarist and also singer. But usually you do or you are very good at singing or you are very good at playing guitar.

 It's like the standard, you know. I wouldn't say that I'm bad, of course, when you have more than 10 years playing something, you become something good, but I wouldn't be good that these guys are playing solos on guitars and that kind of stuff.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Do you know the Oriental tool but older than the guitar which is called the Oud?

Hector Palacios:
Maybe I have seen for sure.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Can you show an image of that? Yes. This one. Oh, beautiful. I always wonder if all this instrument, because you have the guitar, like you have a big curve like this. It's older the guitar, but it sounds, it's not like, it doesn't have the continuity like the guitar. It's more. I would say. It's a short sound, you say? You will feel like the guitar have a continuity between the in the sound. Here, it's not like this.

 It's like each sound itself. Well.

Hector Palacios:
It's amazing how many string instruments are, they are like similar to the guitar and older than the guitar. The guitar is the famous one now because you need to get to understand that always, right? But I wonder what was the first one or if they evolved separately, you know, because if you go to China, Japan, they also have their instruments like they are like guitars. And you if you go to India, there is also one that is a very big one.

 And here we also have some of them, you know, ukulele, you have it, these islands, Polynesian countries or islands they have these and we also on South America we also have one I don't remember the names but same same idea yeah same idea all of them are like guitars oh but the sounds of course they sound different no I don't think that I can when you share the screen I think Sorry, I was trying to check how I started sharing.

 When you share, you need to put like include sound. Yes, I was going to share to you, but it wasn't in Spanish.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Okay, I will. This is like an old sound. But I won't. I have heard that for sure.

Hector Palacios:
The sound, yes, it's familiar.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
But I want music only. Not with the... I will find another... Another one, sorry.

Hector Palacios:
like it's similar to the sounds that you you hear on japan the because they also have like a guitar is more similar to that one to the sound of the guitar oh okay yeah I don't know how to describe it but but it's really nice really nice I really liked it let me show you one from uh now that we are sharing the how they sound the different guitars let me show you one in like for example what you would and South America, you know, like, um, anti-planic, the, the term, uh, anti-planic is like the countries between Bolivia, um, Peru and Chile, Chile and Chi...

 I would write it on. It's like the sound between Chile, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. These three countries. And this is the kind of like the landscape that you will see. And these are the animals. So we have a very like a Chinese version of the of the camels, you know. This is the llama. We call it llama.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
This is the llama, yes.

Hector Palacios:
We have llamas, guanacos and the cuña. They are like different species of the same family, but they are cousins of the camel. So they are cousins. So I don't know how, but yes, they are kind of the same kind of family of animals, I understand. And you have different species, another one for sure. And in this region, they have this kind of music that is folklore for us as well. Folklore is like popular music, like roots, you know, and this is like the sound of that kind of guitar, man.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Do you hear it? Yes, I can.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, it's like you see, like it's more high tone than the other one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Do you hear?

Hector Palacios:
It's like it's much more similar to the ukulele. You say something because No, no. Have you heard this song in the past? Probably not, because we have very different cultures, but this is a very international song, so maybe you have Oh, it's 1.7 million.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Well, that is a very beautiful song.

Hector Palacios:
I don't know if it's going to be right for you, because what I have learned from music is really what is familiar to you, right? And so on. So you're seeing that there is like what you can consider like good music and what is not. And the reality is that that definition doesn't doesn't exist. It's like if you are familiar with this, your brain get used to these patterns, to these sounds and you love it because you understand it.

 But as soon as you start hearing something that is very foreign or like unfamiliar, earlier, it's difficult at the beginning.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So it takes a time, you know? Yes. You know, it's my my first manager was like to listen to Beethoven and like this. And when we were all fresh breads at that time, my team was we're talking about a new song. That released yesterday and they are singing about it and they asked him that do you listen to this song my manager said no no this song all of you will forget about it tomorrow because it's easy easy come easy go but if it's catchy at the first So it's not a good song.

 He says that a good song that you need to repeat it a lot of times, then then it's familiar to you and then you love it. But if it's catchy, so it's not a good song.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, you said that you said the right word is because it's like pop music. You know, it's easy. You get it because it's like a pattern that is repeated so many times. Music that you hear. And it's like very easy, like right away you get it. There is like one example of that. It's a worldwide hit from Bruno Mars that he did a song with a Korean gear. I think it's called APT. And that song is like you hear it at least from guys from Occident, from us or maybe the Japanese, the Koreans.

 I don't know. You hear it. It's like Nice. OK, I like it. But probably you get bored really easy of that. Yes. And then I can hear Queen, for example, Bohemian Rhapsody. That is a complete new kind of song. And yes, that is safe forever. It's like a classic for me.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's complex, you know? It's complex, right? Like, you know, we have old songs in Egypt. And the period of 17s and like this. It's for a woman called Umm Kulthum. And the one song is about 30 minutes or 45 minutes.

Hector Palacios:
45 minutes?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
For today's standards, that's crazy.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes. This song is, you have pure music for 10 minutes at the beginning, or more than 10 minutes, just music. And then she starts to sing. And she repeats every, every period of the song about 10 times or 20 times. Then they go to another word, about, five sentences and repeat them also 10 times and like this and also 10 minutes ago again with pure music and like this for 40 minutes. Wow! Yes, at my first job, I was a manufacturing engineer creating a bit of materials and 3D drawings all the time.

 After six months, I get four from the job because I do the same thing every day. So for all of my life, I didn't listen to this woman. But at that time, I needed to listen to this because I have about 10 hours of work for the day and I need something to be interesting. So at this time, I to this woman. And for now, I love I love I love her so much.

Hector Palacios:
Wow. Wow. That's amazing.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes. The song is 30 minutes or 40 minutes. But if you are you are after after listening for her for many times, you think that the songs with five minutes is not a song, not not a thing.

Hector Palacios:
I got interested. You need to send it. I don't promise that I will hear the 35 or 45.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Not you can just I will send you the most.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Most popular one.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
OK.

Hector Palacios:
It's crazy because now nowadays you need to have formats and if you need to play this on the radio, you have a limited time because you need to share with the other people songs, you know. Yes and we got used to consume very fast you know if you enter to social networks you want to see the videos that last like 30 seconds two minutes it's like the getting the interest yet or interest of people is becoming more and more complicated every time yes you you want to have a fast gratification yes yes Ben, tell me about you.

 What about your family? What is your current situation?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
What did you study? So on. OK. Start with the college. OK. OK. I studied also mechanical engineering. Ah, yeah.

Hector Palacios:
I remember that one of the guys that So you are the guy, great, great. And I was doing a lot of explanation and yeah, you are exactly like me.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I studied mechanical engineering and in our college we have after, we have three years, preparatory year and then two years of generic mechanical engineering. And then another sector, I choose the production and mechanical design. And after that, I worked as a manufacturing engineer for a bus company. I was creating the bit of materials and 2D drawings and the routing. Most of my job was calculation.

 Enter the data on SAP and then one day per week I go to the factory and just check if the data on SAP is like the process on the factory.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, it is the reality.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, but not the manufacturing engineer who is based on the factory who do another task like process improvements and like piece. That wasn't my work at that time. I just make the calculations and the manufacturing documents and then enter the true data on SABS and then compare the reality with the system. After that, I joined Philips Lighting.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, the international company, right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, but I was in a position to localization a program, localization program to trying to find suppliers in Egypt and and make up there is a project called the in Philips to verify the supply supplier. So that was one project for me to trying to be quite a supplier.

Hector Palacios:
It's like a tendering process to check the, it's like, how do you, it's a selection basically of the supplier?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes. At first they choose Uh, the Check the financial supplier, the quality. And, uh, the machines and Also, the flow of the currency. That is, uh, and and try to make assessment to know if the supplier will be capable to manufacture. Philips products or not and how much he will invest to buy new tools or new machines or he is already have the machines and the tools.

Hector Palacios:
So basically you are assessing the financials, quality, technology and investment capacity that they can have for future innovation basically.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I also work in a company not for that company, but I did a project for a company where they also needed to select the suppliers that were going to do their products. So it's like a very rigorous process in which you need to select many aspects and variable dimensions to create a final classification, I guess. I guess you need to mix many things that are very numeric-wise. With things that are like qualitative.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
But for me at that time, I was an assistant for the project manager. It was a very good position for me to see the overview of a process in a young, and I was young at that time. It was a good opportunity. But the problem was that this position wasn't clear and wasn't to have a specific job description. Because I was just that system. If he needs something, if he needs analysis, if you need me to go to the factory to check something like this.

 It was very good, but not a stable job.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Hector Palacios:
OK. Yeah, yeah.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yeah, it's interesting about that, if I remember correctly. Yes. After that, I joined ABBE, my last job as R&D engineer. And it was like a small project. To have an improvement in the product or to launch a new product. So we have the market requirements and then give our proposal from the R&D and then trying to make alignment to this proposal with the manufacturing and the supply chain mainly. If the alignment is okay with the factory.

 So start this product in the market. And then start again to have a feedback. If the new feature or the new product is okay with the market.

Hector Palacios:
Wow. Looks amazing. I am checking this ABB is a Swedish company?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes. Switzerland. Switzerland.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Both. Ah, both.

Hector Palacios:
OK. That's a really beautiful country.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Switzerland.

Hector Palacios:
And I've seen that they have some robots. Yes. Is that the core now or is the electrical components or is the robots? What is the core?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
We have four business, one for electrification and one for robotics and automation. And I don't understand, I can't remember the fourth, but they have four business and like each business is like a company.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, they have different business units. Yes, business units. But what is the biggest one? Because there is always one.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Okay, the electrification one is the biggest. But it's not the most profitable. Because this business needs a lot of factories and a lot of employees. And in the end, the product is like the electrical panel. And maybe the electrical panel is not profitable. Like if you put one robot.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Hector Palacios:
Probably it's much more exciting exciting the robotics part because it's like the hot topic right now, you know, right now, AI, robots, all of that is like in 10 years, probably I will have one at home.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
You know, ABB have a huge R&D center for robotics in Switzerland.

Hector Palacios:
Beautiful, I really like this automation part. I'm more in the like programming, that I really love optimizing and automating things, programming. I think that is my strength, but I really admire as well like this part of having something more physical. So I find it amazing that it's not what I usually do, but it's really compelling to see something like that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Can I return back to you? I just want to go to the bathroom and I will come back. Okay. Sorry.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry for that. Okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I can keep the meeting.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yeah, for sure. I can stay here.

Hector Palacios:
Okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I am coming now. All right.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello? Hello, man. Sorry.

Hector Palacios:
We call it in Spanish, we say it's a technical stop.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Technical? Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
It's like a way to say when you need to go to the bathroom or something like that.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Oh, OK. All right, man.

Hector Palacios:
So you were working on AVB and then you come to SCM. So it's a It's a big change on the context that this is a company that was creating a final product and was really interesting, to be honest. I really am into this robotic part, but here you have another kind of stuff. It's what I have told you. It's like many learning growth. Like international teams again, the possibility of traveling, to connecting with people from all over the world.

 And it's more in the software part, because the other side that you were describing is more on the hardware. And now you are in this side, it's more analytics, you know, like programming a little bit, statistics. Statistics. So yeah, I think that it can be really interesting to find because you can also develop a whole process. That's the idea. And you can support the process with the tool. So hopefully you really like it because I think that the job is great.

 The product is also great. So it's just a matter to create something beautiful. The main difference maybe is that here is when you create something at the end. You are with your team, you are creating because it's not that standard, you know? You have a product that, of course, you want to start from a base because it's easier and the standard is also always great, but you need to customize as well.

 And you can design a process, you can decide the steps and you can play a lot there. You have a lot of flexibility and there is where consultants come into place to create nice stuff for the clients. And like every one or two years, you have a completely new project with new people, new aspects of the tool. So it's like never stopping, you know? You never get bored. It's like what I tell you is like, I found this job and for me, I haven't lost interest because of the same, because it's like every now and then I'm changing again and I'm doing this and I'm out of the comfort zone again because you need to meet new people and you don't know how they are going to be, you know.

 So it always keeps me interested. It's like changing the company many times.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes. What about your family?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I have, I live with my mother and my sister and brother. I have one sister and one brother. I am 28 years old and my sister is 29 and my 24. Yeah, you're very close.

Hector Palacios:
That is more normal. My second sister is 6 years old difference and then with the other one is 17.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
That's like very far away. You know, I have another brother. He's 8 years old. But he's not my sibling. He's from my father brother okay from my mother only and uh he he is his half sibling yes he is uh he lives in in uh he he doesn't live with us but I meet him once a week well

Hector Palacios:
that's great and that's right that that is more normal you know because when you have like uh from another family know that you have that difference. It's like the usual case when you have this gap. I have a co-worker here. I'm at the office today and one of my co-workers is also, he also has this family and he also has a sister that is older and then he has a brother that is the same age because they are like twins.

 Not identical twins but they are twins. And then the father also has another family and he has very young brothers as well.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So that happens.

Hector Palacios:
In my case, my parents, like, They were not planning my sister, you know, so they they were all. Well, I'm kind of very close to that age and I don't have a child yet. So for like years ago when when they had my sister for us, Like my mom having a child at 36 years old was like, oh, I'm very old for this. I shouldn't have been having because my mom had me when she was 19. Very, very young. I also was not planned.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
I also was not planned.

Hector Palacios:
And then my second sister, she was the only one that was planned. Did want to have another child. I mean, my mom was 26, you know, and then 36, we were not planning to have anymore. It's like, OK, no more, just two. And then they got my sister. I don't know what was the mistake, but it's a beautiful mistake.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yeah. Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
And that's why we have like this gap. But for sure, they were not planning to have more, more, uh, shines.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Uh, I think, uh, the same with my, uh, youngest brother and, uh, my, my brother.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And this is it.

Hector Palacios:
Yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
My, my, my, um, my, uh, now now he is attached to me because my father passed away two years ago and now it's okay now now for him for my youngest brother it's hard it's hard because he's still young and he and he attached to me like like because I am old for him, like father?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah, it's different, right? It's very, very different. For you, it needs to be a stronger feeling, that probably for me, because he's very, very young, you know, 20 years old of difference. And I think that's great. But for me, in my sister, it's kind of the same. She's my sister, but I got into college when she was born. So it's a It's a whole, you know, it's like you understand very well.

 So, um, the point is that I don't see her like my sister. I see like, uh, I need to take much more care of her. I see it like that. I cannot say it as a shy as my daughter, because it's not. And I think that that is a stronger meaning, but it's half the way, you know, it's between the sister and daughter. She visited me here in Spain. So when she was very young, I entered to OCM and I was starting earning money.

 And I told her, I will get you to Disney one day. And I didn't fulfill my promise until like three months ago when she came here. And I took the opportunity and say, OK, Paris is very close. Because here in Europe, you know, it's very close to go. And we went to Paris. And Paris by itself was like a dream for her. You know, she was dreaming to go to Paris. And I didn't tell her. And I told her, no, we are going to go to Salamanca.

 It's a city that we have in Spain. But by that moment, she was like, OK, I have no interest in that because it's another old city. The same, I already saw them. So it's going to be the same. Okay, we are going by plane to Salamanca.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And now we are in Paris.

Hector Palacios:
No, we're going to Paris now. And she was starting to cry.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
She didn't know until she arrived.

Hector Palacios:
She was suspicious, you know. She was suspicious like that. Why are we going to Salamanca by plane? Do they really have an airport? If this is an old city in Spain, Do they have an airport? But she didn't want to ask because it was like, OK, maybe my brother is not planning anything and I will say something. And I don't know. She didn't want to ask. But then we get to the gate and the gate said Paris, you know, because when you are in the boarding.

 Yeah. And she was confused. And I'm confused. I said, yeah, we are going to Paris. And she started crying because she didn't. It was amazing. It was amazing. I feel like in a different way. I wanted to do this for her. And when we went to Paris with my mom and my sister and my wife, then I also took her to Disneyland because I was promising that.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And I finally fulfilled my promise.

Hector Palacios:
Very nice memory. You have to realize that when you spend money and the people you love, you enjoy it much more. I can say that it was expensive, for sure. But I don't regret it one bit. I really loved the experience. To give the giver the experience, for sure, was something very, very important for her and also for my mom. I don't want to have these regrets that maybe I could have done this for her and I didn't do it.

 So yeah, I think that that kind of things are really fulfilling when you are doing this kind of things for your family.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, yes. That's why for me also, I hope one day I can make more more for my family.

Hector Palacios:
If you stay at this job, man, that's going to happen.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I plan to leave.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, but that's a reality. I think that there is a huge opportunity at a base. You can know by Omar. Omar, I think that he's doing great right now. But then also the things that we have been talking a lot that is Middle East, you know, is is like the You are at the top of the wave, you know, like in the front. I don't know how to say the bandwagon. It's it's always a good position to be at the beginning.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
Do you have any. Sorry, sorry, I interrupt you, man.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
No, no. Go ahead.

Hector Palacios:
I was going to ask you if you have any hobby. Again? It's like the word, like something that you like to do.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hobby.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Hobby. Oh, OK. For example, music for me. You know, I love reading and running. I love running in the street.

Hector Palacios:
Freerunning. Wow.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's great.

Hector Palacios:
Sebastien? He likes a lot to do that as well.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Oh, very good.

Hector Palacios:
So he was like the, you know, that on GoSiem you can do a run, like once a year they do a sports thing. So you need to qualify for that. Okay. It's not that me, I decide to go there and then I, you need to have certain physical condition and they can send you, for example, the last time they went to Chile, to the south, to Patagonia, and they did a run. And Sebastian, he was running 51 kilometers.

 Oh, yeah.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
No, I just ran 10 kilometers. That's fine. That's great.

Hector Palacios:
I think that many people did that as well. But Sebastian is like very competitive.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, you know, for me, I discovered that running in the college, I didn't used to run. But in the college, I, you know, I discovered that I am not that guy is sitting on the desk and can focus for a long time. That was a problem for me. So I tried to solve by doing sport and by reading, by running and reading. So I can extend my span length of focus, keeping focus. And from that time, I love running because it makes me calm.

 Can you understand me?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, for sure, because I try to do some exercise now because of the age you will understand because you are getting closer to 30 so you will understand what I'm saying in a couple of years probably but then you get your peak at 30 and then you you need to do sports. One for one is good for the health for the mind as well because you you start like um like liberating or creating some happy hormones, I understand, like endorphins and things like that.

 Endorphins, yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
And that is really good for the stress. So I think that when you are taking roles, not in this job, in any job where you are getting to a manager position and you are getting more tasks and tasks and responsibilities, the stress is a thing, right? So it's the other side of the coin and that will always happen. That is the cost of being successful at the end, I think. So you need to complement this with some exercise.

 That's why Sebastian, for example, likes to run a lot. Felipe also is a very sporty guy. He's more on the weights, you know, like the gym. I also do a gym. I'm very skinny, but I also like to do the gym and I try to run sometimes and mostly doing just to be fit and to have some health basically. I'm doing it for the peace of mind and for having like, I don't know, like sugar levels on the good range, you know, the cholesterol and all that stuff.

 I think that you need to exercise, otherwise it's not going to be good for you. So yes, and also makes you smarter, you know, doing exercise. Beside exercise? No, when you do exercise, like running, it's good for the brain. It makes you smarter. It's generating something. I don't remember.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's like brain factor.

Hector Palacios:
something like that it's not exactly the name but it's something it's a factor they call it but it's basically a building block in your brain that when you do exercise it's start generating you know like you're triggering the generation and that is good for the neurons so you are thinking better in reality so so exercise is really good for the mind and I now if You know, I returned to run again when I started with Go.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
That's good. But for the last job, because I used to go to the factory, it was very, very difficult to run. Because the factory is one hour drive.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
It's complicated because you are losing two hours a day. Yes, two hours a day.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And also you are exhausted after the working day. Yeah. Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
So one thing that now, just a recommendation, because now it depends on you, you know, you are managing your time. Of course, in the future, then when you start having more responsibilities, you will have more meetings and you know, so you, of course you need to, um, you are depending on that. Um, but also, um, in the free time, you are the manager of your time. So what I do, for example, sometimes I go to the gym in the middle of the day, you know, and then I catch back later.

 But I work by objectives. So I can decide if I can, I want to go in the afternoon because I like to be outside of the peak hours because like many people, they are going in the morning or just after the job to the gym. So I prefer to, to go like in the middle. So I have more like a space flexibility. Otherwise it's difficult because their resources are limited. So you are owner. Just a tip, try to have a routine your way because that way you don't work more than needed because the difference is that in the past you went to the to working and when you come back you are really switch from work to home, you know, in that time.

 Now you won't have that. That makes sense. Exactly, you need to push yourself to do that because then now as Because your home is your routine. Yes, exactly. Now your home is your work. So you are working from home. So it's difficult sometimes to set the lines. But it depends on you. That's the good thing. You can affect it. You can change it. It's just, let's be aware of that. That sometimes, that maybe if you are not putting a habit to stop working and doing something else for some working you can end up working like two hours more and you you will not realize yes yes of course so

Abdurahman Hamdy:
try to have the balance yes and you also like reading again you like read you like to read yes I like reading and But, you know, also, I have, like, not a good feeling, like I didn't discover myself yet. So I am aware that I need to discover more about myself, what I love, what I don't love, what hobbies can I mimic. Maybe I love it, but I didn't try.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I mean, I think that we are like a blank disk. If you get what we are, we are not. I don't think that people are supposed to do something specific. I think that we are we born and we have three options. Maybe you want to be a doctor or maybe you want to be an engineer or maybe want to. You can be great at whatever you want. I think that you have all the options. I think that the real recipe for this is like whatever you do, you need to be great at it and you are going to love it.

 Because it's a kind of feedback. We are very social, right? So whatever you do great, the group is going to tell you, OK, Abdurahman, you're a great man. And that is what we really love We like to be accepted by our people, you know? So when we do something where we feel that we are contributed to the group, to our community, is where we feel the greatest. I think that's the point. So it's my recommendation, and I'm just a single guy.

 I'm not the single source of truth, of course. I don't pretend to be. But what I think is that I don't think that I was born from music. I just think that I got the opportunity and I got into it and I developed for many years and I love it. But that's why I dedicated time to it and it became good. But for another man, maybe he was into painting and he developed that and he became great, an expert, 10,000 hours probably, or something like that.

 So it's just that, man. It's whatever you do, just spend time on it, get great on that, and I think that you will find what you're looking for.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I hope to discover more.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I know, and you are open always to discover what whatever you you have the whole life. In front of you, so you can find things to do.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
For sure. And also to to. You know, I am I believe that. I am not in my best version of me and Need to be better. In career and also in personal life. And I think I discovered this in people, in dealing with people.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How is that?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
On my own type, I think that at the beginning, it was easy for me to be nervous from bad attitude of people to have questions about why people do this and like this. But I think by time I, when I understand more about myself and about people and their life, you become more kind to people and not judgmental. You can understand that people can can make wrong things, but still not not bad. Yes, you got it exactly right, man.



Hector Palacios:
That that's the way to go is something that I struggle with my wife because she is always taking everything personal. So my boss today was like very grumpy. You know, he was not a nice guy today. So it's like She's changing the whole opinion of the boss, that the boss is a great man, very funny. But just because of that one day, she felt that he wasn't like the best boss in that day. She changed her opinion.

 But reality is that your life is complex. Other people's life is so complex. You don't know what's happening that day. It's just a circumstance that day, but you need to think on the long way and people is really nice usually. So don't take personal. You need to, if you want to receive like, like, I don't know how to say it, but if you want people to be nice with you, start you being nice with them no matter what.

 So, yeah, I think that that's the key. And sorry for this, but I think that I need to jump. Oops. It's also really late for you.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's like one hour. It's okay. It's okay. You have a meeting?

Hector Palacios:
Yes, I have a meeting, but I shouldn't have a meeting. Why have a meeting at this hour? Ah, yes. It's because it's another guy, but he's from South America. He's from Argentina. He's working on a project that I have. I will tell you the next time but I have also another project in South America, where I'm the manager from GoSCM side, and also I'm meeting with my team there. It's not part of my cluster like you, but it's working in my project.

 So I have this meeting with them to see how these things are going. So yes, we'll need to jump in, but let's meet the next Tuesday and we can continue the discussion we're having.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, nice. Okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Thank you. Thank you for that.

Hector Palacios:
Have a nice weekend. You too.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Bye. Bye.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Bye!
