Patel, Rahul:
you Let's wait maybe for a minute for everyone to join and then we'll start.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Sorry, we're late. A lot going on. OK, I think we have everyone. Hadi, I might or I need to join another call in parallel.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I'll try to cut it short, but since you also were on the previous call, I think I might or I'll try to join a bit later. The two key points. One is what we were discussing about training approach. Two, what Raoul will tell us about this new urgent thing, if there is an impact or not. Yeah. So let me try to cut the other one short.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I'll hopefully join in 10.15.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Sure. That's fine, Thomas. No worries. Thanks.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let's start with the training approach since this is still fresh. I'll brief the team at a high level, Nikita, and then maybe you can voice over what you need from everyone. So in a nutshell, we're trying to track the whole training thing, who gets involved, when, and what content is needed. So there are a few questions that we need answered, right? The initial question we need to push Asma on more aggressively is who's involved, right?

 From each AGC, from each business line, who are the people that will be part of those trainings? So that's something that the CM team and ourselves will try to manage along with Asma. Even though she may have delegated this to somebody else, this is something that eventually will fall in her lap. We have the support of the SteerCo, so it's on us to start pushing her to give us that list of names. That's point number one.

 Point number two is what kind of content are we using for each of these segments of people, right? So some users might need access to some content, other groups of users might need access to another set of content. That's a main that we need to put together. The reason we need to put it together is to estimate the effort and the mode of operation for each of those trainings. Okay, so that's point number two.

 Once all that is said and done, we can sit with Khaled and tell him that's the approach, these are the people that are involved, this is how they're involved, and this is the venues by which we will conduct those trainings. For each of these groups of people. So that's in a nutshell how we're going about it. Now, this obviously is becoming more urgent every day, with obviously the main urgency here being identifying the people.

 I'll pause here, check if there's any questions, otherwise I'll leave it to Nikita to continue on this point. But it's pretty clear what... Okay, one at a time.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Whoa!

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let's go by order.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bishar?

1Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
Yeah, so I was speaking to Tarek about this. The original plan is to send it via the memo, to be sent to leadership. So it will come from the inventory leadership to the group company leadership. But Tarek... Bishar, is it sent out? One second, Nikita. So my question is to Raoul, because Tarek told me that you're checking something...

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Wait a second, wait a second, Bishar, excuse me. Can you... Answer my question. Is the memo sent out?

1Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
No, but I'm asking because Tariq told me Raul wants to add something to the memo.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's why I wanted to check with him. Okay.

Patel, Rahul:
So, Raul, can you give us some clarity on this and when this check will be done? So, basically it was Tariq had invited a call with me and Khalid and he had questions or he wanted some clarity because he was talking to end users and some questions for this so internally they were discussing that these questions led to the urgent meeting which I had planned which means uh I would I would like to answer this question after i've explained the point which tarek has read so is this something can I take up this uh the urgent request what I had which I have discussed with the technical team, which is not complete, but I would like everyone's attention to.



Roumanos, Hadi:
So, okay, are we covering this point now or are we covering it after the training?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, that's what, because if I...

Hector Palacios:
I think that the Rahul point has the right implication of the training, so let's do that.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah, let's do it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Go ahead, Rahul. Okay.

Patel, Rahul:
So Tariq, as Bishar mentioned, Tariq approached me about a few questions, and this led to a revelation that there is an important aspect of demand planning, which got revealed in today's morning discussion. Essentially, the demand planning process depends upon the approved material reservation, which means the forecast IBP is proposing will not add much value from a demand planning process. So that was the discussion which I wanted to have with the team to align on what does it mean from this input, from the process we have today and what does it mean in terms of how we want to proceed from a Golio perspective.

 Now if we don't consider this And the current process, if we consider, then the feedback from Tarek is the current process should be impacting every end user of MRO, because today every end user provides demand input in the respective AGCs, in the respective functions, and the respective departments. And their role, if they have to do something in IPP in similar terms, then he needs that clarity up front so that the communication, the memo, will include that.

 And what Tariq mentioned as this users are not in hundreds but are in thousands which means the change management scope would be drastically increased and it will it will directly impact our project timeline. So that's why I said Tariq let me have this discussion internally in terms of how you want to reply to this and come up with a proposal acknowledges this input summarizes that what it does what does it mean for us from a project perspective and then how we reply to this action in terms of how we mitigate so that it does not impact our project timeline so that's the overall summary of the point at this point of time i've had partial conversation with the team yes who's who's this person what is his role he is the person who is helping us identify all the key users across AGCs.

 So he's part of Asma's team, who's talking to all the AGCs, identifying focal points and helping us get the end users. And he's coordinating this communication to the EWM team, so that the memo can get communicated through the leadership to the EWM community.

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
So sorry Rahul, I just have a question on this, because in the template we created, business roles not necessarily IBP roles so would that have an effect on that template meaning would we need to update it?

Patel, Rahul:
No it does not see whatever business role what we mean are IBP business role only in IBP you'll have business and technical role so when we meant business role it is IBP business role business users doing work in IBP so that's it's it's not related to the change we did but then we need to basically reassess the process and get back to them on what does it mean and at what level which activity should happen because the way the current process is designed and if we continue with it, it means it gets all the end users from maintenance are part of the solution scope.



Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
But it's not about the view rights, Raul, right? It's about the people who who will be contributing?

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, so yes, so Tariq feels and this is what something they discussed that initially they thought one person per group would be responsible for coordinating within but they think that after the discussion analyzing the process it's not one person but all the people of respective agencies who are today contributing in IBP in demand sorry in S4 HANA in demand would have to contribute in IBP in demand because they are the owners of demand, which means these are thousands of people across agencies who are today from maintenance perspective are doing planning and raising reservations in S4ANA, which drives the procurement process today.

 So it's a critical point. At this point of time, I've had partial conversation with the technical team to analyze the impact. In the meantime, could speak to an EAM expert from IT, who is kind of senior to Khalid, and he is one of the experts. He's equivalent to Vignesh, I think, in terms of EAM expertise, and who has some decision-making ability. So the solution, we kind of discussed, me, Vignesh, Khalid, this point with him, with a few feedback from him is the process we have designed is exactly what maintenance team needs but the maintenance team will not adopt this process so from a change management so what he is suggesting is the process should not change but we should have a strategy from a change management perspective where from a go live perspective probably we only focus one agency and user and have a different version of process which is slightly different than what it is so that the agency one agency adopts approves and over the of time of hypercare, in next few months other AGCs will adopt.

 But if we try and think of going to all the AGCs at once, we cannot achieve this as part of the project timeline, is what he confirmed. But the process, he said, will bring extensive value to the EWM team, so we should still push for the process. The next steps I feel would be to have a detailed discussion. I think right after this hurdle with the technical team to basically discuss about my discussions with different stakeholders, get everyone on the same page, decide upon the actions on the process side.

 And then based upon that, decide on actions on change management side in terms of change management strategy. And then based upon this discussion, We need to go back to Tariq and define a communication. So this EAM expert who is equivalent to Vignesh also said that the only thing which will work here is memo. And you are working in the right direction to define this memo. But yeah, we need to have this clarity before the memo can go.

 Did I make sense? I know we'll have more questions.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Everything is clear. Have this discussion Rahul.

Hector Palacios:
So Rahul I guess that this is new information after our call right?

Patel, Rahul:
Yes this is so that's where I would not like to say conclude on any actions or any impact unless we together come on a call and continuous discussion where I will be able to essentially bring everyone on the same page based upon my discussion with different people so that then together we can decide and discuss upon the OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right, let's discuss.

Patel, Rahul:
So if there are any other points, we can continue and probably continue on this hurdle after we close on the points.

1Rocio Minguillon:
My thought regarding the whole training discussion that we were having, apart from this, was like we talked about the definition of of the end users. But also, I just wanted to ask about the strategy and the approach. If you had the chance to present to Asma the three options that we review the other day, or in which step are we regarding that, regarding the approach of that end user strategy that was out of the initial scope train the trainers.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That was my...

Rocio Minguillon:
I think that is another point regarding the training. Yes, go ahead. May I respond very quickly?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So we had another meeting with Mohammed Namani and Hadi just before this call. We discussed this, right? And so we agreed on the strategy to move forward with collection of the end-user numbers. As soon as we have the numbers, numbers, then it will be very clear to us in terms of how we would structure it in a practical way, how we would split the groups, etc. But now, with this input from Raul, I think this exercise is dependent on what Raul has just mentioned.

 So, let's go in the sequence. So, let's go in the right sequence. First points from Raul, then we continue our quantification with that input, and then we come to the finalized change strategy.

Rocio Minguillon:
And then the finalized, okay. Okay, sure, sure, sure. But we're okay then in the key user strategy, that's, I mean, that's set and that we have the data for that, and we are starting to develop the content in a few weeks. Yeah, yeah, it doesn't stop us.

Patel, Rahul:
It doesn't stop us from structuring the content by courses or modules. Yeah, we should continue working on content irrespective of users or what is the training strategy, because I think the content will be consistent with how we deliver it.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, all right.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, sure. We are on a line.

Bastian Osorio:
Thank you. What about the sessions of next week sessions demand planning MRO?

Patel, Rahul:
Let's talk about it. I have a thought, so if there any other point to be discussed or should we this call on the point I've mentioned?

Roumanos, Hadi:
We can continue this call on this point, Rahul. I think I'd rather focus on the important stuff and not waste time on all the line items that we have in our RISC.

Patel, Rahul:
So please go ahead. Okay, noted. So I'll share my screen and I'll start with the Excel sheet I was trying to discuss with the team. So I'll take five minutes for everyone to be on the same page based upon our discussion and then we'll take it from there. So essentially we are talking about MRO demand. The context is MRO demand. So the current demand planning process is that they have work order. The work order triggers reservation.

 The reservation is approved. And then based upon the approved reservation, MRP executes. If it is stock material, which means it has a reorder point planning, stock would be available, which means you'll consume from the stock. If it is not a stock material, which means there is zero stock. And for zero stock material, PR will be generated. Now, the additional input what we have received today is that there is an enhancement in S4 HANA, which considers only the approved material reservation, which means there can be thousands of work orders in the system.

 But if the material reservation of the work order is not approved, it is not an input to inventory planning, MRP. And then the inventory team would only convert the demand, which is equal to the reservation approved into a procurement proposal which is purchase order. So this is a critical input to our process because if this is the input which means demand is equal to reservation and whatever forecasting we are trying to do for corrective preventive maintenance in IBP does not become relevant.

 Now this also from an approval perspective they already have an approval mechanism system in place for reservation. Every end user in maintenance community who's doing the maintenance based upon his maintenance activity creates his own work order. And the reservation goes through approval through the existing approval mechanism and goes to the planning. Now what we are trying to do in IBP parallel to do is to create a forecast.

 Right based upon historical consumption, and the forecast needs to be reviewed and approved. Now, and the idea is that the forecast which is approved becomes demand, and that the demand is used for procurement proposal. Now, if the demand is only dependent on material reservation, whatever forecast we are trying to generate is redundant, because the forecast will not drive anything, it will just be a number, and then people are questioning if I'm already doing approval in S4 HANA, why do I need to do anything in IBP?

 Because it already goes through a process, and that is the demand. And also the inventory team confirmed that they also identify this approved reservation only as demand. They don't want to procure material based upon forecast, even if it is approved, if there is no reservation approved against it, which means we have this conflicting input where we are trying to generate a forecast. Which becomes redundant, and we are asking for the approval of the forecast, whereas the entire process works today on material reservation, and the expectation is that the same process should continue in IBP.

 What does this mean for us? Which means either you change the demand process, where there is no forecasting in place, and we simply take the input of material reservation, that becomes the demand. No one works in IPP from a demand perspective, because already someone has approved it and demand gets automatically approved and then is available for inventory, for inventory planning and approval, which means that whatever benefit IBP is supposed to bring into the process is that the overall business case or the value added to the project gets limited.

 Also, we don't know enough now what is the planning horizon for these reservations. I talked to someone called Mazar is an equivalent of, say, Vignesh. Vignesh is a procurement IT expert. Mazar is an EAM project manager and SAP expert. He's a very senior guy, and he has worked in the organizations both from procurement side and EAM side. So based upon the discussion with Mazar, the horizon, what I today they say is up to maximum one year, which means whatever forecast, whatever, if we use material reservation as a forecast input, then we will have only forecast for one year in IBP and no one needs to review this forecast in IBP because it's already approved on S4 HANA side and then the inventory planning happens and the supply planning happens.

 Now while This makes our process easy. We don't talk to end users and we have very limited people, but this is not in line with Adnox requirement. That's what I'm assuming. Because even the leadership said that they want the demand, the end users to drive accountability for the requirement. Now, the solution we have today as part of the current BPD which is signed, that solution was explained to Mazhar and Mazhar said the solution is exactly what we've been trying to bring in or struggling and this solution will bring a lot of value to the EWM community.

 But the challenge he sees is the EWM community will not accept this solution because we are trying to change their process and for them to accept this solution, what he recommended is as from a project perspective. Let's take an example of material ABC. Let's take an example of material ABC. These are the attributes of the material, which is historical consumption. Then you have a forecast based upon historical consumption.

 Then you have Reservations, and then you have user input, and then you have, say, final demand, approved demand. So, for, let's take three months example, Jan, Feb, and March. Based upon historical consumption, the forecast is, say, 5, 5, 5. Reservations, we have 10, 10, 8, 7. There is no user input. So the recommendation from the EWM expert is that we should have this solution in place, but from a deployment perspective, the strategy should be that for the agencies who do not agree that we will not do this work, this approved demand should be the reservation, which means the reservation becomes the forecast and no one approved, no one has to go into IBP to approve it.

 For the AGCs, probably one or two should be taken. Who is saying this Rahul? Who's recommending that? Mazhar, there is, there is someone called Mazhar. He is, he is equivalent to Khalid or sorry, Vignesh in corporate office, who is a very senior person and he is an EMX expert and EM project manager.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So he handles all the projects on EM side. They don't accept to do this, accept to do that, that's even if he thinks that's the reality, it has to be Khaled and Firas decided. So we'll take this reality check to them and then we'll decide.

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, yes. So essentially the recommendation is that whatever solution we have is exactly what is needed by business because business will not accept to this solution because of the change we are trying to bring in. The primary reason is the end users focus on the maintenance and they will not focus on approving or rejecting in demand unless they see value to it and as of now they are satisfied with the current process of reservation based planning which means from a project perspective the process we have decided is correct it's valuable but a deployment of process should be in two phases first phase is to essentially recognize reservation as the final demand without user making any changes which means from a go live perspective we have limited scope of change management and user At the same time, we make this process available to the leadership.

 And then we do a POC after go live for one AGC, which is a smaller AGC, where they adopt the final process what we have. And then maybe a few months after that, the ad hoc leadership directs everyone to adopt this process without having any review or acceptance, which means it has to be a CEO or a senior vice president level memo, which says that this is your process from tomorrow. But to adopt. But before this memo happens, from a go-live perspective, we should have this approach is what his recommendation is.

 Now this is where the forum is open for any questions and suggestion how we proceed with this. Have I been clear in understanding the issue, the change, the impact?

Hector Palacios:
Let's talk about the value. Let's talk about the value because many times we have said that what we can bring to them are always only for fast movers that are very, very tiny portions. So I'm not sure that these guys that thinks that we are going to bring a lot of value are aware of this situation. Because if we say for the 95%, we are not going to make a difference. So thinking that this is such a huge effort to bring all these people to work this it doesn't make sense at all?

 Because if we are going to change this for 5% of the data, is it worth it?

Patel, Rahul:
So the reason why there is value, the reason why there is value in what we have proposed is because the current process, the majority of materials are reorder point planning, which is stock, because they are not forecasting what is exactly required as per the firm demand. Everything is becoming MRO, whereas the fact is only 10 to 15% of actual material consumption belongs to MRO, which means if we are able to segregate between, sorry, corrective maintenance.

 So if we are able to segregate between corrective, preventive, and maintenance, which means the reorder points which are set up will drastically reduce based upon only corrective maintenance data, and the preventive maintenance data should be forecasted based upon the actual maintenance plans, to the point where he acknowledged that if we are able to look at the maintenance plan, that's something they would like to even have from a EAM perspective.



Hector Palacios:
Okay, but let's tell you one thing. So, the forecast is not because something on Adnox side, it's because the models are not going to work with that data. So, when I'm saying that let's use reorder point for the 95% is because I'm saying we cannot calculate a forecast for you.

Patel, Rahul:
That's what I'm saying. So I get your point because you are assuming that 95% material do not have forecast. But the point he is bringing is there is corrective. There is preventive. And preventive is around 70% or 70 to 80.

Bastian Osorio:
70 to 80% of consumption is preventive and only 15 to 20% No, that is a problem because we have seen the data and the data is not telling us that.

Patel, Rahul:
So let me put my point and then you can correct me if I'm wrong here. But I'm just communicating the point which was discussed with Mazhar, which means that if we are able to distribute, use, differentiate the consumption history and preventive is driving a separate forecast and corrective is driving a separate forecast then the reorder points which are set today which basically cover the entire demand would get reduced drastically to the corrective to cover the uncertainty of the corrective only whereas preventive can be planned and actual.



Hector Palacios:
But the preventive would be a plan on their side so an input from us or are you expecting a forecast because then that is not the best practice for us. If we need to do a forecast, then let's mix everything together. Let's do like chemicals, you know. Preventive for us is a separate input because it's a certain, it's a plan. So if we have certainty on something, let's use that, right? Instead of a forecast.

 But if you have no plan, then it's not a good practice based everything here. The best practice is that they should plan what they are going to use on the right frequency but that is not on the IVP round.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so I agree the preventive what we discussed there are the current preventive maintenance ideally should come from maintenance plan which becomes input to the IVP but the workaround is also something I did not recommend this workaround but this is something which has come from Marder saying that looking at historical consumption for preventive and looking at the maintenance One, we predict the future consumption of preventive separately and then the procurement strategy should be aligned to directly procure preventive irrespective of there is a material reservation or not.



Hector Palacios:
Yeah, Bastian can tell more about this but we were looking at the data of preventive trying to do something similar and it doesn't look good.

Bastian Osorio:
Look, I can share my screen. I have the data here.

Patel, Rahul:
Alright, so this is what we have discussed. Now based upon this discussion, please recommend or please let's discuss upon what happens in three funds.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
From a change management perspective.

Bastian Osorio:
Can you see my screen? Just for a second. Yeah, Pasteur is already sharing, Raul. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Sorry. The blue bar is corrective and the orange is preventive.

Hector Palacios:
Maybe they have everything in general, that's the point.

Patel, Rahul:
General is part of corrective or preventive?

Bastian Osorio:
No, he wants to sum up both and create a forecast for that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
When you say he, means who?

Patel, Rahul:
Hector.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Hector Palacios:
It's just, but let's keep talking about preventing and corrective. General, we don't know, Raúl, what is that?

Bastian Osorio:
The thing is that We spoke about this with Nabil, and he mentioned that although there are clear guidelines of how to use the different type of orders, users, it's a work in progress. They are not doing it, and in most cases, the classification is not accurate, meaning that those consumptions are in theory, but the order style historical order type do not reflect that reality. What do you still need on the call?



Naamani, Mohamad:
Do you need a change management team if this discussion is beyond the daily huddle or risk list?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I don't think so.

Hector Palacios:
I think that we need to discuss internally.

Patel, Rahul:
Technically the change management team is required because it directly impacts the process, directly impacts number of users involved and the training set.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, no, no. Raul, they will be interested once you will finalize not when we're discussing and not clear what we're coming up with once we have a decision we'll say this is changing or this is not right yeah yeah okay so change management team can leave if they want to.

Patel, Rahul:
We've summarized so everyone is aware of the issue now I think we can focus on the process part of it and agree on the process so that the impact can be discussed with the remaining people.

Naamani, Mohamad:
because I had another call. I have one request. I might need to have a five, 10 minute call with you to understand or maybe you can send me this and I'll do a homework. However, like we discussed before, if this means a change in the process or in any of what we agreed in the design, we need to be aligned before and then bring it to Khalid and discuss. So the brainstorming or the session that Hector mentioned, the internal discussion, are the options are valid.

 But we also need to have a sort of summary saying because of the following findings, etc, we promise this now things are different, or these are the options so that they can help us or confirm the decision. I hope my point is clear. It's just like we all we do the options or analysis. And then we brief them before we do any change on our side so that we don't end up redoing things.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed.

Rocio Minguillon:
And the impact on next week's sessions, I assume that we are also discussed as once we have a technical discussion, or are we able to make a decision regarding that right now?

Patel, Rahul:
Once we have understanding of how we want to process, then the UT session becomes pretty clear.

Naamani, Mohamad:
At this point of time, But there's not enough time Raul and team to do this change.

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, so that's what at this point of time I think we should continue with this UT discussion with our current process. Acknowledging the fact that this this request is there and sharing this with the team up front that and the only change what I see in terms of process would be whether we want to consider forecast or whether we want to consider reservation as input for planning. Now if we take up this, If we agree to this change, which means that the reservation becomes input for planning, which means there is no impact to the end user community.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Please, Raul and everyone, let's continue with UT as planned for a simple reason. Think of it this way. This point could have been raised during one of the UT sessions. So what you'll do, you'll take it, you'll say we'll check it out because that's the purpose also of UT, them getting acquainted, but also us We're calling it validation session. And this way, we don't have to rush last minute now. And at the same time, we keep this in the back of our mind to analyze it and decide what are the options.

 What I'm saying, let's not immediately jump to changing decisions before we have the chance to breathe and assess it properly. I don't know if the rest of the team agrees, but also those things will keep coming up. And my concern is because of the- of the audience and the community, they might push us in a direction that when you go to the owners, the owners ultimately, so the sponsors are business, Asma and Co.

 Owners are Khalid and Mansouri, who said in the first time I met him, you listen to the business, but if they push you in one direction, we are ultimately the owner of the project, they are the sponsors. So when those discussions change the course of the leading practice or what we recommend, we owe them that explanation, saying, dear Khaled, Firas, et cetera, this is what we're facing. Whether it's related to what data we found or what data we didn't find, or someone pushing because the end users don't want to do the job, help us decide.

 Before we immediately say, then this would be the, it's like us immediately reacting to things that later on will come back and bite us. That's my request, because we'll face so many of them.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, but the thing is that it's still like, I think the similar example is drilling. We're getting the information by pieces and it's very hard to, and I think Rahul is doing a good job on the last couple of months collecting this information, which is relevant for the design. And unfortunately for us, we didn't get the right information at the right time. During the sessions that were design sessions.

 We're getting information as we progress in this technical and with Rahul at the office. So how we can address this? For drilling, we basically say, OK, let's step back and let's recalibrate the solution. And we come up with something that is more suitable. It looks better. Here, I think the impact is not as big as for drilling, but still it's an important thing.

Hector Palacios:
It's kind of the same thing, Mo, I think that as I see it, it's very likely that we do a step back here, that whatever we propose for that is going to be changed based on this new input. We can go with the section, the point is that probably those users, we are not going to involve them anymore.

Rocio Minguillon:
But they are not key users. They are key users, the ones that are participating, or are they these end users that will be affected by this change?

Hector Palacios:
But either way, either way, the end user, I don't know, because there are dozens, like 1,000. But it is something that we can maybe postpone one week, like switch one session, I don't know. Because if we go on Tuesday with this, knowing that it sounds like a bad idea based on this new information, the decision probably is going to be bad. So do we want to expose ourselves?

Rocio Minguillon:
Are these persons exactly who I was talking about? Or are they the famous leaders that they want?

Hector Palacios:
They are people that probably if we change mind, they are not going to be involved anymore. So I don't know if we want to just involve them right now just to get a very bad feedback. And that is starting with the left foot in the scene.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But what is the alternative in this case?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Just one thing about the users. For the sessions, the users, people who will be in that workshop are the same people who were invited in the design workshops. There won't be any end user in the UT sessions. The end users will be in the UAT.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Is this people from the maintenance team?

Patel, Rahul:
No, these are the same people who are talking about from the design workshop who have reviewed and approved the documents and to the same people will be showing the Now, the point I'm trying to make is that we are not talking to the end users who are finally getting impacted. So, the workshop agenda should continue. At the same time, the EM expert expressed that the process we are bringing in will bring in value to the organization, which means the process is correct.

 It's just that the ad hoc is not ready to adapt.

Hector Palacios:
Rahul, let me stop there. Let me start. They seem that it's going to bring value because they this is magic and it's not. That is what this thing that IEP is going to be. I will create like the most, the better forecast. The reality is a shock. It's a slap in the face. So it's not like that. So let's align the value together. And because for me, it's very uncomfortable going to Tuesday and present something that I don't believe that is going to be an added value.

 And to try to make a case for something I think that is not the best option here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed.

Patel, Rahul:
So the point I'm making is we owe this analysis to AdNoc where we say this is the best practice, we'll bring in the best value, but this practice will not work because of one, two, three reasons. So if you want to adopt to this practice, these are the two, three changes you need to do for the best practice to work. Now, since the best practice cannot be adopted, this is an alternate solution. This is what in line with the end user requirement, current end user process, as well as we agree to the process because of the one, two, three reason.

 And then let them decide upon whether they still want to push for an ideal solution, knowing that it will not lead to a good outcome, or they accept this proposal of going through the revised process and then come up with a strategy implement the ideal solution in a stage manner which can be after go live as well. So the point I'm making is rather than we assume in concluding and presenting something, we should give AdNoc this opportunity to understand and agree upon the next steps.



Bastian Osorio:
But we need to come up with a with the best possible solution with the information that we have. As Hector was saying, if we don't believe in the solution, considering the last information we have, then we need to come up with something we believe is the best. Otherwise, we're not going to propose just for the sake of they rejecting it. Why are we going to propose something that we know is not going to work and they will going to reject it?

 Let me ask you this. What was your plan for next week?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Ignore this discussion that's happening now. What was the plan for next week in the list of scenarios you prepared and the walkthrough you wanted to do?

Bastian Osorio:
I think we shared the script.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I know. I meant not to walk me through them. What was your plan? To show them the leading practice? To show them what could work? So what is the logic you were planning to start the sessions with?

Hector Palacios:
For the preventive, we were going to be transparent that we are not in a good place. So that's one thing. The good practice is you give us this information, the reality is that they don't have it, the workaround is let's try to forecast this, reality is so forth. So the point is that we are going to say workaround that we said on the design session that we could try to do this is not yielding any good results.

 So the reality is that we are not in a good place for preventing.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That is what we were going to say. But this is not. I mean, this is what you usually do in a UT session, isn't UT session to go through the scripts and tell them that's what should happen. And then if you have gaps, as you said, from the data, you'll tell them why this is not possible. As opposed to have the UT as a session of bad news. My concern team and maybe it's me. For example, Rocio, you I sent you an email.

 The two list of scenarios that I got one of them doesn't have scenarios. The chemicals, for example, it only you saw my email Rocio you on this.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, it doesn't have like the brief of scenarios, all the scenarios regarding chemicals. But why?

Naamani, Mohamad:
I mean, in the first one you have the list of almost 35 scenarios.

Rocio Minguillon:
But it's the same, that's like a brief. I mean, that first page is the same as the others. I mean, it has these scenarios, but they are not brief in the first sheet. I mean, they... I don't know if you understand. Maybe I can show them.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, I understand, but what is the logic is what I don't understand.

Rocio Minguillon:
Why we have a brief in one and not a brief in the other? Because they were like configuring and following the configuration by using the MRO scenarios that are very similar to the other ones. So that was just something to ask. It was on a status sheet.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah. It was on a status sheet. The MRO is next week, chemicals in the following one. So we are focusing entirely on MRO.

Naamani, Mohamad:
OK, so it will be built at one point. Okay then back to my question and we need to be cautious. What is your expectation from next week and the one after? Based on my understanding we want to give them a preview so we'll do this orientation on Monday if it's confirmed and then Tuesday onwards we'll give them a preview or we'll show them not a preview we'll show them the different scenarios that we picked.

 How do they happen on the system?

Hector Palacios:
No I don't think that we are going to be a step by step step-by-step scenario, not all of them are equally important. We are going to focus on the main things that we'll see. There are many additional things like segmentation that I prefer not to focus on that because it's not the big issue. It's something that we are going to get either way. There are things like, you will see the results for first time.

 You will see the layout of the tool for first time with your information, now with dashboards and alerts and things like that. So that's what we need to show. In UAT, we can go step by step, doing all the steps. We have enough time for that. We have like five weeks, I think. Here we have only two weeks. So yeah, it's going to be much more reduced and not all the points.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But guys, I feel this is a bit changing as we speak. First time I understood from Bastian that what you'll do is you'll run the different scenarios and we'll give them the chance to try the scenarios on their machine. Yes, that's why I'm saying. Then Hector, you said this is not, there's not enough time. What we'll do is we will run the different scenarios after we give them the first orientation session, like how to navigate the solution.

 Then in the three sessions of MRO demand, then three sessions of MRO inventory, et cetera, we will go through different scenarios. As you said, it could be some emphasis on one, less emphasis on the other, so that they can see all of them, right? Isn't this what's happening?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, but remember that what Steve is thinking is like to do an introductory session where they can see the system for the first time.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's the one on Monday, yeah. Yeah. That's what I was referring to as Monday. That's why Monday or this orientation session will happen. And then when you go, it's different topics. It's demand for the first three sessions. And then inventory for the other, so on and so forth. Is this still the case? I'm a bit concerned, I know we're working till the last minute, but I want to make sure that we have the similar objectives or expectation from the session.

 The session is, as you said, is to show them different scenarios, but you need, and I mentioned this yesterday, that Khalid also emphasized it, by the end of the UT session per topic, you need to make sure that the list of scenarios that you will do and that you will apply and we apply internally in SIT, then we will do with them and UAT is fully approved by then. So. No, I mean, I don't think that's feasible.

 No, no, no. You didn't get you both. Sorry. What I'm saying, the list should be approved. Not the actual run of every one of them. So what we need to tell them, so I'm a new user. So I was in discussion of the design and I told you this is my expectation. Now you're giving a session in this UT to give them a reality check. This is how IBP works, orientation session. Then let's show you how do you do, let's say segmentation or I'll see the results of the segmentation after you do the run.

 Let us show you how you see the forecast of the demand based on history or this or that. The idea is you need during those two weeks to confirm with them the basis of UAT acceptance in terms of what is the list of those different scenarios and what they are.

Bastian Osorio:
Otherwise, how can you run the show during UAT? I want to come up with a solution that's clear, but first we need to face the problem. The reality is that users in just three sessions for demand planning will not be able to approve all the script for, not say, okay, those points will cover, but at least, because with just three sessions, it's very unlikely they will get the full picture of what is this about.

 They will get some idea of what it is, of what the system can do, but they will have plenty of doubts. So the expectation that they will sign, okay, this is the script that we're gonna have to test during unit testing, that's not gonna happen during unit testing. If we start working with them, they will raise plenty of new observations, and they will forget about some requests, requirements. And that's the reality and happens in every project.

 That is why the methodology has changed to Agile, where as users are experiencing the tool, we start to prioritizing the new requirements. The problem here is that we plan to basically users approving a solution that they barely have seen.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay, I understood part of what you mentioned, but I think you're still mixing the two things, at least for me. Seeing all the scripts, you're right, there would be not enough time, but there is a sort of sequence. We did design workshops, we converted this into BRD and BPD, and we told them this is on the BPD, this is what the solution will will basically provide you with, right? And based on those BPDs, correct me if there's anything that's wrong in the sequence or what was done.

 Based on the BPDs, we came up with the scenarios that if we showed to them all of those, it will be a mirror image of the BPD so that they can say, yes, whatever you promised us in BPD, we've seen it later on in in UAT, maybe now it's a preview in UAT, a subset of, but in UAT, they will see all of them, have the chance to check, give you feedback, maybe correct fix, and yes, this list is a correct list, and all the cases are passed, so we're out of the UAT.

 What I'm saying now, you need to lock that list of scenarios from now, you don't need to show them every single scenario and for them to accept it, etc. Because you'll have more time, either from now till UAT, even you could do some sessions in parallel. But UAT, the scope of the UAT or the list of scenarios should not be a moving target. That's my concern.

Hector Palacios:
What we can do in that regard is that we can show them the core. So they have this very high level understanding and they have the idea of maybe they will realize, okay, this is aligning to what I want at high level. And then at the end, we can, with Rahul and team, we can dedicate some time to, okay, you have seen this. These are the scenarios that we are planning to cover on UAT. Should we add something else?

 We can do that exercise at the end, so we can look, as you are saying, so on UATs are not a moving target, but it's something that we are aligning with them after they have a much better understanding of what is going to be A, B.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, so you think it's better to do this at the end, not at the beginning. Maybe at the beginning you'll tell them, look, this is the list of the scenarios we'd like to walk you through. Some will be quick, some will be more in length. And then this is how we'll spend the two or three sessions on this. By the end of the session, so we need to keep a decent amount of time. Why is Raul on hold? He may have been pulled outside of this call.

 I mean, we cannot repeat this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So you're saying, Hector, you will start, you'll show the list at the beginning, but until they feel it or see some examples, then at the end, you'll say, based on this, this will be the list that will be our reference for UAT. That's your point, Hector, right? Now, another technical or not technical admin reason why we have it, I think Hadi mentioned it, is they also need to load those cases on their LM.

 It's like they need to confirm what the UAT scope will be based on the following list. And that's why, although Agile, as you mentioned, Bastion, is the logic, but it will not be like Agile in terms of you'll multiple UAT. I think AdMob is rigid enough not to help us with this Agile approach.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I think they will be very strict on what we're doing versus what we're not doing.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's what I'm explaining is that Agile in terms of as we're doing this UAT or this preview we might have a couple of UATs as we're working now finalizing before we reach SIT UAT. However, the final list or the list of scenarios scenarios is already set from the beginning. We're doing agile to take a chunk of it or a part of it and show them and then later on maybe more advanced scenarios. But the idea is you're not going to extend the list of scenarios as you go.

 You're confirming it now and then deciding what to cover, etc. And that's a very important point because you don't have that luxury of continuously updating the list because of their process, but also for you to control your scope.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, I'm clear with that, but then how you deal with this kind of situation, with new information, with users getting more involved in reprioritizing based on their needs, based on the better understanding. I want to follow, of course, what we plan. I understand that, but there is some uncertainties we need to find a way to process them. In theory, the users have a good understanding of what the system does and how it works, so they can make their requirements based on that.

 And the other way around, we are clear on their requirements based on how they work, based on the organization, so we can create a quality VPD. And then finally, we design the solution and the users can use it. Is not reality. The reality is that as we move, users get more ideas and they haven't been very friendly or smooth in sharing their information. We're getting the information by pieces. So the expectation that now during the UATs or unit testing, we're going to show exactly what they need and they just have to test it and accept it, approve it.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Again, that's why I'm saying you misunderstood me. I'm not saying this UT will be a copy of the UAT. It doesn't make sense. This is a preview of UAT from two perspectives. Getting to know the system, how it behaves, as you said, orientation, that's one. Getting alignment on the list of scenarios that will be checked during this UT, maybe not all of them, but at least you'll show the full list, and that will be the basis of UAT.

 Then the third objective is to let them play or see the system how it works so that they convert that conceptual design into reality. It's impossible for UT in two weeks to do what you're doing in UT. I agree with this, but also it cannot be that UT is a free form, free style way where we don't end up confirming the list of scenarios and we're not giving them a preview of what leading practices is, how they should function, and we're converting UT to adapting to their situation, immediately moving from what we recommend as leading practice to coping with change.

 So here, I'll give you back the stage. You said we have some challenges. How did you do this in previous cases, in previous projects?

Hector Palacios:
It's more, in previous projects on our side, it's more agile. It's like continuous sessions with the users, immediate access to them at least twice a week, but all of them not that sometimes I will join to a session and then not. So, I know it's a bigger complexity and that adds a larger complexity of challenge. So, yeah, that's the case. So, I guess what we can do here is because Because I understand that the moving target is not a good idea, especially in this case.

 Let me finish Basti. What we need to do is to have a backlog here. So whatever, because it's going to happen, everyone knows it's going to happen. Some of the new requirements may drastically change what we are doing. So those we will need to address and see if we need to take to UAT. But most of them, are not going to be significant enough to to do a change on UAT or the scope so they will need to understand that whatever they are asking after the UAT we will add it to a list of open points that we are going to prioritize accordingly and then with time after UAT we can take them and that can happen after even the go live I don't know because depending if if this is not huge enough then yes we can take it after when we will have time and we can maintain our target, how to say it, static, right?

 That's my question.

Bastian Osorio:
We need to have a strategy, a methodology to face the uncertainty, the new requirements.

Hector Palacios:
Yes, we need to have a core team that is approving, saying this is priority, this is not priority and we can push That is how I have done it in many breaks. But we have someone that is helping us, and in this case it needs to be Muru and Jagannath, all these guys, that we have the sessions with certain frequency, we address all the new requirements that came after the design,

Naamani, Mohamad:
and we decide, okay, this is how- No, you're right. This is for new stuff, or objections, or pending points. And you use this more score, so this is a must-have, this is nice to have, this is in scope, this is out of scope. If you remember, we even had some of those points during design and certain things were shut down or others we included. We said, okay, yes, this could be done this way or that way.

 The point is that's only for additional request. I'm saying for the existing list of scenarios that you already identified, which is based on the agreed scope in BPD. How are you planning?

Hector Palacios:
I would say, especially for this topic that Rahul is saying. I think that nobody on AdNoc is completely sure of the proposal. The proposal is high level based on what we know that is MRO, but when you see the data, as I said before, things can change, right? So is nobody sure that this is a huge value and not in our place because we are taking, we are proposing without data and not in their side because they never believed on our forecasting.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
first.

Bastian Osorio:
What do you mean? What do you say, Hector? Well, just complement the same happened in drilling. Same happened in drilling. And this is part is the nature of this kind of project. We have to take a step back and reformulate the design. Why? Because it's yeah, we're building a complex thing as users get more and more knowledge to try to give more but not about accessories and stuff, but about the core solution.



1Rocio Minguillon:
OK, so I I have a suggestion here. Let me know what you think. So from the just thinking about the technical side we until yesterday we had a list of scenarios and a list of requirements that we're putting on these scenarios. Now we see that from a change management perspective perspective, Rahul discovered that this can change and this can happen. So let them decide what to do. I mean, we can present this to Hallet, for example, and say, OK, we have this, but we know that the users that are involved next week, there are some end users that will disagree on the process, on the value, on the different steps that we will be facing.

 So let them decide. Because from a technical side, the only thing that we can do go through that scenarios and then raise the backlog if something is changing or if they don't agree on some steps. But we are also...

Naamani, Mohamad:
Or there is something pending because during that scenario run you were missing data or there is a disagreement on it, etc. Exactly. I let you finish because I think this is how we need to proceed. Okay. Finish, please, Rocio.

1Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, okay. So, I understand the change management perspective that Hector was raising, that is, if someone is there and we are presenting something that he's totally disagreeing about, then we are starting in not a good way. But maybe that is the thing that they should decide. I mean, if they want us to go with this technical procedure, is supposed to happen, then we go with that and then we face the consequences.

 But we can ask them and let them decide. I mean, do you want us to rethink on this with these leaders and then do this unit testing the other week or the week after that? Or what do they expect?

Roumanos, Hadi:
My only concern is that Khaled will not be your main point of contact for this. He will not come up with a decision if you present him with these options. He will likely tell you, have you checked with the business?

Naamani, Mohamad:
I'm anticipating his reply, right? Okay. Yeah, no, no. I mean, but we also need to find a way. So let me suggest a few fixed requirements. So first of all, we definitely need Khaled not to be listening only in the Khaled and Asma and whomever she will delegate. So not optional attendance and this is something Hadi will mention tomorrow to make sure that they are in all the sessions to address any conflict or disagreement.

 That's number one. Number two and I need to make sure this is possible. I think what Rocio you said is what I was referring to before. Let's not go into the UT to show the scenarios only after the limitation or what can happen or not, or keeping in mind those users will accept or others will not accept, etc. We need to present those scenarios based on what we designed and got approval on, and our process is dictating.

 The process is saying step number 1, 2, 3, 4. This is what's due. What will happen, who is doing what, and then this is how the system supports. Then, when we discuss the different scenarios, we will highlight that due to lack of availability of some of the data, what we are able to show you now is this, but typically what happens is the following. And this is like we're raising a pending point saying, originally what we discussed in the meetings in the design was this based on leading practice and the sample data.

 Now as we see the data, this might have a change potential. The other one is the one related to the users that we were referring to, some will accept or not. I will not change the course of the sessions next week or the one after, simply because we realized either there's something in the data or some of the users will push back, et cetera. Let the UT start with what good looks like, the ideal way we recommend.

 And when we do this, we'll say, by the way, that's how it works. However, we have a gap here, because when we're pulling the data, there is this part. Honestly, I joined late. You were talking preventive, corrective. Maybe you were saying, because until now, we couldn't figure out if something, work order is tagged as corrective or preventive. We still need to work on it. However, if it's one of those, this is how it works.

 Is this possible? Bastian, Hector, definitely everyone, but Bastian, because you said, I don't want to start with something that is basically not applicable to their environment. But first, we owe them to see the ideal solution. And then in the discussion, we'll tell them, because of limitation one, two, three, this is something that we And that's why the scenario we're showing you looks a bit not complete.

 Does that make sense? And Bastian, is that the logic that you were planning to you and the team to go into? Or I think we need to agree. We do not want to go with compromises into those sessions. We want to go into the real solution and highlight the constraints or the limitations that will lead to compromise and get their input. Tell me what you think about this approach.

Bastian Osorio:
I agree, I agree with you, I think.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Go ahead Rahul.

1Patel, Rahul:
Further to build with what Mo said is that this session will also help us get alignment on whatever change we want to bring in. Like if we say that we want to change the process because we see this problem, but rather than we changing the process, we show the problem and agree that OK, something has to be changed because these are the people who have given us approval to the process in the first place.



Naamani, Mohamad:
So why Asma and Khaled should pay attention the whole time and their core team so that when after the each session we have pending points if we go to Khaled we'll tell them please explain so we'll go to Firas please explain this we need to make a decision or we have the following pending points we need to make decision. So yes it has to it will be an opportunity be it related to people pushing back and they will not convert from reservation to demand forecast or whatever or others expecting something but the data isn't supporting it.

 Rahul, you're done? I cut you off just to get the final. Yeah, that's the point I was trying to say.

Patel, Rahul:
This is an opportunity for us also to commit this change.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Sebastian, you were saying something. Please, if you want to repeat, but most importantly, explain to me something related to data. I thought the drilling is where we're facing some challenges in data, but MRO and chemicals were in better shape.

Hector Palacios:
It's fine, Mo, the data is fine, the quality of the input is not okay. I mean, it's the real data, right? But it's not good for a forecast. Explain a bit more. The numbers, the real numbers they have, they are not a good material as an input for forecasting. You you cannot forecast whatever, right? If you have a continuous consumption, you will get a great forecast. If you have two points on the history, you will get some simple gap.

 That's the scenario.

Naamani, Mohamad:
OK, I think this is the point you raised two weeks back when you said because of the scarcity of demand or not that frequent demand, it will give almost zero in terms of forecast. However, that was the first cut of the data. Then when you continued on other material, You have now a mix. Some items are like this, others are better. Is that correct, Hector? It's not across the board.

Hector Palacios:
Bastian was seeking that and it seems that the point is that here we have so much data more that even a 2% is going to be a lot. The point is that do we want to propose a whole change in the structure of how Agno is working and involve 1,000 users just for that 2%? That's my question. Because this is a huge, huge challenge for us. So I see it more as an opportunity, as a way out of this, because if we commit to going this way, that can be very bad for the project, because it's something that we will not be able to promise,

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I think.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, no, but guys, why is it an immediate action? We cannot have today saying we'll opt out or remove it from the project. The idea is, if I understood you well, and I'll let Raoul and Bas in comment, we can give them a reality check that now that we ingested the data, we can say we have three buckets. There is one bucket out of the 1.4 million, like a million, that have decent demand data in the last three years, which is I think what they have on ERP.

 Another bucket of 200,000 is okay, and this is what we suspect will happen. And another 200 out of 1.4 are basically very bad. So, Hector, I think this is what you're saying, but if you don't walk them through the thought process, how you got there, no one will support you in the decision. They'll say, how did you get to this? Or why are you ignoring those? Did I understand your point correctly?

Hector Palacios:
We are not in the position of trying to convince them not to use It's the other way around. They don't want to use a forecast.

Bastian Osorio:
We need to convince them to use a forecast, and we don't believe in that. That's the point. Just to make it clear, there's two sources of forecast, two sources of demand here. Preventive, which are like schedule activities, and corrective, which are by nature are not predictable. OK, for corrective, which is a source of uncertainty, the system works well and works with a safety stock. No forecast.

 The forecast just works to create the reorder point. OK, you basically have a quantity in the stock and you deal with the uncertainty by having some...

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's the corrective, which is accidents or whatever happens and you need to read demand and try to forecast that corrective. Action again, right?

Bastian Osorio:
But, but, but not for you. Don't, don't try to forecast because you're never going to nail it. You're basically calculating a safety stock. How much do I need to, to have in stock just if happens, right? That part for me, it's covered.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But for safety stock, you will assume a similar trend for those corrective actions like it happened before, no?

Bastian Osorio:
Based on what? But it's not a forecast because you will not buy based on that. You just have something in stock and just wait until happens. The other part is the one that drives PR, which is preventive. Prevented orders by nature is not forecastable. I don't know how to say it. It's not predictable because it is based on plants. For example, I change the oil of my car every year, every 10,000 kilometers.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The lubricant, whatever.

Bastian Osorio:
But you cannot calculate that with a forecast because first, we don't have the data for that. We check the data and there is not enough data to do that. And they should maintain that manually. But they are doing that in S4HANA and they have a complex, sophisticated process in S4HANA to do that. So what's the point of bringing this process or create the expectation that the system somehow will be able to create automatically a preventive consumption that is not feasible?

 There is no way the system will know when you need to do preventive plans. The only way to do it is through collaboration. Will they be able to collaborate all the preventive plans for all their equipment in the entire AdNoc? I don't think that that is the case. I mean, currently, it's not the case. What we do is that they act reactively. When the equipment fails, they change it.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And they expect that the inventory controllers... It's almost... No, no, no. I mean, guys, it's almost we're saying this solution shouldn't be implemented for AdNoc.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Naamani, Mohamad:
because also guys you need to be careful about how you phrase and how you also explain the situations. I'm talking now if we're in front of the client if I'm listening without all the background knowledge you're almost telling me this solution shouldn't have been it's not going to help Adnok. I'm being very clear again it's me playing the client saying based on what you and Hector said you're almost telling me this solution will help me with nothing let's discard it.



Bastian Osorio:
I'm being I know, I know, but I'm just telling you a piece of the software. I'm not telling the full, the full, I'm just talking here about one of out of four modules.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Bastian Osorio:
Inventory, huge value.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
Then invent because Just to be clear here, but we're able to calculate inventory What is the right amount that you need to have in your stock to deal with the uncertainty?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah Which is by the way the way they do it right now If they man they don't work going to yeah, if demand is not going to be very applicable to them How would inventory? Module work without input from demand It just uses a history.

Hector Palacios:
It calculates a flat rate, demand rate, yes. It's a parallel measure, it's not the focus. And that is the best practice and that is how MRO is structured.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's even what SAP said for MRO flavor, specifically of IVP? Yeah. If you don't have this, you'll do that?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, in the inventory, calculations for MRO, we have never used the forecast for calculating safety stock. It's a demand rate. That is like a simple average, so you don't need to read...

Bastian Osorio:
No, but it's more than that. It's more than that, but the point is that you don't need the planning. That's the point. No, no. Yeah, that's the point, but it's not that... I mean, there is a complex, sophisticated model to calculate the reorder point. That's the core of the solution.

Hector Palacios:
But it's not depending on the that whole point.

Bastian Osorio:
So depending on the historical consumption.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, exactly.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Which is which is coming from demand planning, no?

Hector Palacios:
No, it's just an input.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Additional input is a But who is the module that today is aggregating the historical consumption? No, it's the inventory. If you have inventory without demand, yes, you can get it directly from S4. That's your point. But I thought that demand is reading this historical consumption. And as you said, based on whether it's useful or not, it will either do a forecast or just show that consumption as input to inventory.

 Rahul, you wanted to say something?

1Patel, Rahul:
Yes, while I agree to what Hector and Dakshin has to say, the only point I would like to say which AdDoc will say to us is that guys, this is MRO. By the nature of MRO, you're not supposed to consume everything every day, which means the historical, the pattern would be like very limited consumption which means if we are seeing that because it is MRO and it has very less consumption we'll not be able to forecast we'll have to like prepare then push back or they'll explode in our face yes yes so we have to prepare a better answer because this is MRO and that's the basic assumption of nature of the MRO business you don't have a continuous consumption like an automobile or any other product it's not a sales product it's an MRO which means And this is the point that Hector and Bastian again, we're one team,

Naamani, Mohamad:
but I'm explaining if I'm in the client's shoes. So. Yeah, the way you mentioned it. So yeah, let me explain in this case so that we're aligned on the message. The way you explained it, Bastian and Hector. I think Raul's point is yes, in reality it's nature of MRO, but I think I even heard you one point one time mentioning that depending on how frequent or infrequent or unfrequent, whatever that demand is, it will, I mean, and how much data that you have, it will improve the results of forecasting.

 So for the client, rather than give them a zero or one or saying your data is lousy, basically we're saying we're importing the data, you have a lot of items, the more those items are consumed, the more accurate because that algorithm will have more data And the less, it will be basically less accurate. And I think, Hector, maybe I heard you in one of the sessions referring to this.

Bastian Osorio:
So they'll understand. Yeah, but I want to say something. There's only one thing that we're saying IBP cannot do. Cannot forecast accurately your preventive plans. There is some value that demand planning can add, yes. But this value is not what they're expecting.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed.

Bastian Osorio:
And just a couple of sentences. What is the value that demand planning can add? We can do a forecast on a high level on a quarterly basis for the next five years. With that, they can negotiate better contracts because know on a high level how it's going to be their consumption. So in terms of more strategic and tactical, in tactical terms, more strategic terms, the inventory controllers have more input and have the possibility to plan long term.

 But then from an execution point of view, there's no value that demand planning get on the daily job. That's the responsibility of the of the maintenance team, of the engineers and so on and so forth. The only thing IVP can do is plan long term and help them deal with their uncertainty by calculating the right amount of reorder point.

Patel, Rahul:
Exactly what we should do is give this information to AdNoc, tell that this is the limitation of data and this is how, this is what the best we can do with the data we have. And for AdNoc to further use this tool to the best of their they need to improve on the data and let them decide based upon this current state how they want to proceed. We give this option to Aitonog rather than we deciding. We share this information or insights with them.



Naamani, Mohamad:
So yes, Raoul, yes, but with a bit of fine tuning of the message. Correct. Again, guys, we can, we can, we can discuss about the language. But so we close this call and we get this ready. We sleep on it to tomorrow. If we have a call, we don't need to repeat always the same discussions, but The idea is to agree on this message so that next week we're all speaking the same language. Even the word of, this is the best we can do with your data, for me should be rephrased.

 The idea is we collected your data right now, we've checked it, and we're configuring the tool so that you can get the best or the max out of this solution. We've also identified certain improvement areas that if you work on from the source data, be it S4 or maybe DWS for drilling, etc. That will improve further on this, so that at least from their perspective, they're getting something now, it's good, maybe not excellent, and we're telling them, look, what you have is a good start, but you need to improve on it.

 Using the term, that's the best we can do. It's in itself, it's also a negative statement saying, It's like when someone would ask you to clean something. Okay, this is the best I can do. That's it. Basically, it's half-baked. Again, don't take any one of you take this personal, but I'm playing this role where I'm on the receiving. They paid millions for this, spending time. They need to understand that it's not magic.

 Hector said it. But at the same time, it doesn't mean if it's not magic, so it's either yes or no. There is a starting point point, like the thing Bastian mentioned, that there would also be benefit from long term, even from short term. Remember one thing, maybe today, because the data that they have on ERP since it started, the one ERP only started two or three years back, is basically also not that good.

 I think Vignesh mentioned that sometimes they have something in another system. As they run IBP further, things might even, or logically, things will improve. This is a living solution that will feed on data as much as they have more data and more accurate data, it will improve. Agree on this message so that we show the brighter side off and tell them, look, again, it's as good as you improve, so you need to continuously improve on this.

 And by the way, this is the list which I think Kushboo and Raoul working on those recommendations, what do they need to change and terms of practices, filling some fields, not keeping data missing, so on and so forth. Before we close, we have Kyle and Raoul.

1Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
So much for not extending the calls. Raoul, go first because I want to ask a question based on the outcome of your discussion.

2Patel, Rahul:
Sorry, this is related to the change communication we're trying to do?

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
No, so I wanted to, yeah, so I wanted to ask if this is, if I understood it correctly, you're going to put this together and show this to AdNoc and present it to them. But this links back to the memo that needs to be sent out, right? Because Tariq is going to be sending out the memo to the VPs. And with that memo, we will be sending out the template to identify the end users. But Rahul, you said earlier that this memo is dependent on the outcome of this.

 So if this is going to...

Naamani, Mohamad:
Why is the memo dependent on the outcome of UT?

Hector Palacios:
Because if we don't do this process, there is a bunch of people that will not be part of the project.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But let's identify the bigger set first. And then later on, if we need to reduce or not involve some of them, that's easier, as opposed to wait more and more until we're clear and then that hassle of identifying the user is taking forever unless I misunderstood the point.

Patel, Rahul:
So Khalid also agrees to this and that's where I wanted to align first before we go back to Khalid and say that let's not link memo with this communication but let's have this conversation tomorrow morning with Khalid give this perspective to him on the he is already aware of this issue because he was part of the discussion but But then let's agree upon at least closing the memo with some understanding or genetic understanding till this issue is resolved

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
during the next week discussions. But role that memo be able to be closed tomorrow. Because yeah. OK, because I just want to let everyone know that the template for the end user identification is going out with that memo so.

Naamani, Mohamad:
of us proceeding with the memo, I always use the same logic. That discussion we're having could be one of the discussions that came out after a session on Tuesday or Wednesday. So why do we freeze things? Why do we need to freeze things that were planned because of things that we face now? Let's continue with the mainstream and expect that there will be some fine-tuning. Again, unless I misunderstood.



Patel, Rahul:
Is that possible, Kamil? Yeah, there is one impact on the chain management number of people getting identified. The current process we have, if we, if everything is okay in idle world, AdNoc right now is recommending that every end user who is raising MERTIL requisition or work order in... Rahul, Rahul, sorry, I'll cut you off.

Naamani, Mohamad:
It's clear to me. If we send this memo and then later on we realize there are certain things will be cut short, it means we will involve less users, not more, right? So what we're getting tomorrow is the superset. If we realize that after approval from ADNOC, Asma, Khalid, etc, that there is a change, of course, then a subset of those users will not be involved, not the other way around.

Patel, Rahul:
No, no, there is one more aspect to it. Now, so initial understanding was you have no, so there are sets of users, right? There is no MRO. There are MRO which are leads in respective area and there is everyone area MRO. Now, up till discussion till afternoon was that we are having this middle set which is leads of MRO, which is probably in hundreds. Now, Tariq is recommending or the AdNoc is recommending is to go to the every end user and make him a contributor in IBP, which means there are thousands of people about not hundreds.



Naamani, Mohamad:
But Tariq cannot decide who is Tariq to decide on this and we're not pushing back or we're not discussing.

Patel, Rahul:
This is something Tariq Asma and Awadullah discussed internally that's why.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Then why did we escalate and have a discussion as a team saying Khalid we need you in this meeting that's the situation we need as a project team and you to explain understand the situation this is it one two three. Guys you cannot tell them also someone Tariq I don't know what his role is just to play with us as if we're We're amateurs. So we also need so he's just one thing will push back will explain to him that this is not possible.

 Even ad hoc do not want to train 1000 people for this thing. That's what this process is basically.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, then this is what discussed with Khalid and we cannot have thousands of people will never go live. OK, so so I was waiting for this conversation. So that we can go back to Khalid and Tariq and make sure we close this point and they send a memo. That's why I said we'll have to, that's why we did not send a memo today to have this conversation online.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So what you're saying Raul, you and Kyle will go to Khalid and say this is the fine tuning required on the memo before it's out. Basically so that we contain the number of users and then send the memo. But this is not related to the hiccups that we're talking now. About related to data related to the hiccup if you pick less users how would this be different how would this help you let me take a minute for you for me to explain you this cannot communicate to the users

Hector Palacios:
that we know that they are that are going and parked out the users that we think that may not be involved Is that a big issue, to do two communications?

Patel, Rahul:
Because there has to be one communication to MRO group, and they don't want to have a half-baked communication which clearly does not identify the right set of end-users. So the internal discussion between AdNoc, where Mahmoud Awadullah and everyone is discussing, is that today the work order drives demand, and then the work order, there is a reservation which is approved. And every user who is raising work order should be in IBP.

 The discussion before today was that in a site there can be 25 planners, but we will give only one planner access to IBP to coordinate internally and help us confirm the demand in IBP. Now they want every 25 person to whoever are raising this work order reservation to have access to our IBP. If this happens, then the number of users which are like in hundreds will increase to thousands.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But Rahul when I asked you yesterday, when I asked you yesterday about the audience, the number of users, remember you told me for drilling, inventory and planning you had four in offshore, four in onshore, total of eight for basically inventory and supply for others. This is not related to anything. I know. Karawut, please listen to me. I said that we discussed that we're okay from supply, inventory and supply, from drilling and also MRO, etc.

 The area that is still not clear, the area that is not clear in demand, I think in demand you said we identified for demand drilling, it's fine. Chemicals is also under control. The area that is not still a question mark is demand Amaro that intersection but you didn't even raise yesterday that it could be 100 could be 1000 so that's why I'm not clear what where did this come from

Patel, Rahul:
This is something which I got this is something which got discussed today that's why I raised this immediately right urgent issue because till yesterday I was not aware of how many is the talking about today now we are seeing thousands or hundreds.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Why do they need to be involved? What do they do? Do they approve or do they provide input to demand or what is the action they're doing?

Patel, Rahul:
Their logic is today these people are creating work orders, raising reservations and the work order reservations are input to IBP and if they are going to approve this demand in IBP, which means they are the people who are first originator of source and they should agree that the demand in SAP is also the demand in IBP and if they agree then someone will review and it goes to the next level of approval.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What is our process saying?

Patel, Rahul:
Our process is saying the same. They need to be involved? We've not said who needs to be involved but we don't know how many people are there in AdNog.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I'm not saying I'm not saying our process in terms of how many, in terms of what needs to be done.

Patel, Rahul:
Is this in sync with the steps?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. We said demand requesters in the process. Okay. What is changing in their life?

Naamani, Mohamad:
They do this on S4. They don't Yes. But why do they need to do on this on IDP?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What is changing?

Patel, Rahul:
There are two pieces to it in IDP. One is. What they have, which is confirmed demand, which is approved reservation, which these people are doing and there is forecasted demand. Now the forecasted demand is what we've discussed. It depends upon the data and the quality of data and the confirmed demand does not depend upon the

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes, this is a scheduled maintenance or whatever. Yes. Okay.

Patel, Rahul:
So, combination of these two is something they are approving too. But if we ignore forecasted and agree on confirmed demand, then we don't need these people in IBP. But if we agree on forecasted demand as the input, then we need to agree whether all the ideas that comes to IBP or a focal point of this come to IVP that's the discussion which is open and they are and AdNoc is recommending all the users because they are they are also raising demand in an SRP so they should also raise demand in a spoke.



Naamani, Mohamad:
What is what is the difference in terms of number give me an average if you use the focal group or if you use all of them?

Patel, Rahul:
I don't have the number of focal groups that's what so our idea was to get this number of focal groups as the and why did you say thousands I mean I mean, are you assuming for each company you'll have 100 and then this is something. Then I asked Tariq if you if whatever if you are recommending every user who creates work order and reservation, if that's. The people you are going to target. How many are these people?



Naamani, Mohamad:
The answer was we don't know, but it is in thousands. OK, Bastian and Hector. From a sequence of things perspective, Is this typically something that needs to be done on IBP by the demand or the work order owner?

Bastian Osorio:
No. No.

Naamani, Mohamad:
How can you, I mean if it's no, then our process shouldn't have mentioned this this way, what Mo and the team confirmed as who owns this activity as a starting point, right?

Hector Palacios:
So one needs to be the owner, but we inherently knew that we were talking about one dozen people. That's a huge problem in that knowledge in general. There is no one expert for anything. It's variously distributed, the knowledge, let's say.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay, but this is This is an answer to a different question. So today we propose a certain process. When we proposed it, regardless of the number, do we still believe this is the right process and this users need to use the IVP? Bastian is saying no.

Bastian Osorio:
You're saying yes, Hector, but we didn't know it's that many. No, I don't believe that. The solution what proposed is the integration of the maintenance plans. But they don't have that. So we said, okay, then let's collaborate. But we didn't, when we said collaborate, we were thinking more from a planning perspective, not for the work orders. We never say you're gonna create work orders in IVP. That is not stated nowhere.



Hector Palacios:
So the idea of IVP in this regard is that you receive a huge amount of information, like the 60, 80% that Rahul putting in this spreadsheet from integration. So this is the whole work that the maintenance team is doing on S4HANA in their respective module, right? There is a maintenance module and supposedly a huge amount of the information of the forecast is already done by them. This is not the case.

 We are only going to forecast a tiny portion that they are usually not forecasting, that is the corrective. What they are telling us right now is that one, we don't have the preventive, so please create a forecast for us. Now Tarek says no, no forecast here. We just base our demand in approved reservation. That is new information that didn't come in the science session, didn't come in the assist. It's new information just now, right?

 And what is the new information? Approved work orders. So they are saying we are not raising any based on a forecast. We raise it based on an approved work order. Right?

Naamani, Mohamad:
So that is new information from today, after months with them. Corrective is only a tiny portion. Before, Mo, do you remember it was stated differently in the design?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So, the work orders as far as But what is new is this approved material reservation that they have a custom logic for the approved material reservation. Yeah, exactly. This is new. Yes, they always mention about the work order and the work order will create material reservation, which is fine. This is a standard process.

Patel, Rahul:
But then this whole approved material reservation, this is So they also mentioned about approval mechanism for material reservation, which is fine. But the constraint which drives the planning process that they have this enhancement in MRP, which basically includes only the approved reservation as input for planning. And that approved reservation only gets converted into PR, which means the supply planning is constrained by this approved reservation as input from demand.

 This is an additional input or new input which was discovered today.

Naamani, Mohamad:
When we created the slides before on what needs to be done on MRO, demand, etc., did we get to this level of detail or it was only referring to the process, what is before and after?

Bastian Osorio:
No, we didn't get to this level of detail.

Hector Palacios:
But we did mention that we are going to have a forecast in those stages they never say no no guys this is impossible because we have this very strict process they never said that because otherwise we would have cancelled

Naamani, Mohamad:
that and we would say okay we cannot create a forecast and why do they do this Raul that change and and so it's only approved the reservations not all reservation going into the correct so basically this this is the

Patel, Rahul:
way they drive commitment from end users saying that you you can create as many work orders as you want. But only the one which is approved, basically it goes through a multiple series of approval internally from the EWM side. And once it is approved, then only Inventory team consider it as a procurement. Even after this, they lead to a lot of cancellations. That's a separate point. But then this is the mechanism Inventory team has imposed on EWM team to make sure that they don't plan everything from a procurement perspective.



Naamani, Mohamad:
to make sure they are accountable.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And the IBP is expecting or assumes that all reservation are input, not only approved reservation. That's the delta.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's one thing.

Patel, Rahul:
At the same time, we are also generating a forecast. So there is, so one is reservation, second is forecast, but forecast becomes redundant if only approved reservation is input for supply planning. And the forecast is only a namesake or numbersake, only for giving visibility of how the numbers would look like in long-term horizon without driving any supply planning in short-term planning, in short-term horizon.

 So if that's the case, then why do you need forecast and why someone has to even approve the forecast to start with? It has to be an automated number there which gives visibility in terms of how things will happen, which means if no one is approving forecast and the end user has already approved the demand in terms reservation then we don't need any other NIVP to start with. So the number of people involved completely changes drastically.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Raoul, sorry because you're going too fast and the idea is not very straightforward but anyway that's me a bit late in the day. The question is the following, if we need to explain this to ADNOC, the decision makers, Tariq might relay this and Asma will agree or Khalid So we need to be able to explain whether through this Excel or whatever the situation and then it could be one of two things. They might ask us, do you think we should change anything in our day-to-day activities on S4 so that this will improve the quality or you will change your design like you're proposing now to adjust with the reality and we'll proceed, right?

 That discussion is the what should happen.

Patel, Rahul:
Agreed and kind of a discussion happened where the mother guy, the last discussion from EWM project management who was there. So in that discussion, understanding the current process we are having. He recommended that we should have the structure of the process, but we should only depend on. So we should accept this change so that in the shop and we go live without any impact on the the project timeline but in the long time give this visibility to adnog that if they adopt to this process then they have to change the reservation process and depend upon the forecast as input for planning and then once they have the confidence they can adopt this process but it is a valuable thing to do.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay sorry yeah just go ahead.

Patel, Rahul:
Provided the data and everything is corrected which points you have mentioned.

Hector Palacios:
No no no let us go back let us not let us not commit to a preventive forecast that is not best practice that is not SAP recommending.

Patel, Rahul:
It's not forecast so that's what we are saying it's provided they maintain the preventive maintenance plan provided to all the things which we recommend as a best practice so that they can depend upon the forecast.

Hector Palacios:
The preventive should be 80% of this and this is outside IP. It's just an input for us. We are only saying that corrective is the only thing we do.

Patel, Rahul:
Correct, so that's the point. I'm agreeing to what you say. So essentially. The preventive should become an input to the IPP which they should maintain data on S4 HANA. That's the recommendation. The corrective only which is 15 to 20% should drive should be driven by forecast and should drive the reorder point planning. And that's the ideal solution we're talking about, which depends on a lot of things which are not there today.



Naamani, Mohamad:
In the absence of those things, what do you do? Solution as is and wait on them to improve so that you can get the benefits because we cannot design it or configure it twice. We need to configure it one way and telling them this is where you need to be. At the point would be at all, would they accept to change for that prevent or for the work orders the way they're doing now? They have multiple reasons.



Patel, Rahul:
It's not going to be easy to change those habits. That something is enforced by inventory and if maintenance team is taking ownership of this change and they say that yes, we agree to this. We will maintain our data and we want you to look at our demand. We certify this demand in IPP and this approved by us, which is what the even the SVP was mentioning taking accountability. If maintenance team agrees to it, then inventory team who would simply accept it and and proceed with this.

 So that's a change management discussion which we need to derive for that we can assess the impact of the change and put up a plan for how the change has to be implemented over the period of time.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, now let's just remember that is five percent of the scope or less. Let's remember that because if we are going to for solving a two percent or five three percent let's say of the problem we are going to involve all these people is not worth it. This is not a scenario in which with time we are going to get better. This is the nature of MRO. Indeed we have a lot of data. Five years is more than enough and this is not going to change later.

 Meat mowers are still going to be consumed every two years. Fast more like maybe twice a year. So, it's never going to be a situation in which we will get a really, really good forecast on IVP. So, I think that at least I don't believe in the value for this and I wouldn't propose this.

Patel, Rahul:
I would base only this on preventive maintenance, on what they have. So, that's the point I would like to drive here, is that we have 1.4 million MRO materials and 80% of them are preventive and if that preventive, if AdNoc corrects the data the way we are recommending, there is value to this process. It's not that it's 5% of the project because MRO is one major part of the project and we are talking about entire MRO and we are not talking only corrective which is 5-10% or now we are not talking about five fast movers of corrective.

 We are talking about the entire MRO process which includes corrective and making changes in everything. Which will bring value?

Naamani, Mohamad:
OK, let me suggest the two next steps. So I think Kyle we shouldn't send the communication tomorrow. We will raise in the morning huddle. That given the situation we need to have this meeting finalized or make a decision between tomorrow. Asma and Khalid should be on the call. We will need to involve. Then it will be later. In the afternoon, Bassem and Hector, in addition to our team, to explain or to discuss and we'll let them decide who to bring.

 So most probably it will not happen. Friday is half a day and they'll just panic. I think we would need to have this discussion. Let's make sure we have the right people. Tomorrow we'll brief Khaled and Asma that this is a must because of this, the following roadblock. Then we'll book it will make sure from our side we have all the reps from their side and make a decision. Do you agree on this as a logic?

 Kunal you wanted to say something? Don't be very polite because no one will notice.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I think he wanted to say something about half an hour ago so Kunal you need to interrupt.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I lost hope for Kyle. Kyle needed to speak yesterday. Kunal, go ahead. And Kyle wanted to reply. But Kunal, unless you lost hope, go ahead.

Sheth, Kunal:
No, no. I just want to highlight one point. So I disagree with the Tariq point. So Tariq brought in the way of working currently end user is doing, the manual reservation approval process. So before the hurdle call, I did some exploring in the S4 HANA system, and I need to know that the approval part, they have done completely custom in S4 HANA. They're currently using the fairy apps to approve this manual reservation.

 So as Rahul has mentioned, that currently they are having a reservation status, like approved, rejected, as well as pending. So it is more than 2.7 billion reservations they have created. So the point is, whatever we are discussing and we are not going with the plan which we have planning for the next week right so this is the management approval so Tariq cannot say that end user is not going

Naamani, Mohamad:
to approve this solution so we can stick to the plan that is my suggestion instead of what you're saying is agreed that's why I want to expose Tariq now he would say something because we're talking to him I would like him to explain Khalid and to Asma to defend this and from of Firas or in anyone so that Firas will say no guys we brought a new solution that cost million people need to change their behavior or you know what KPMG go CM bear with us yes we'll we'll go for this workaround because it doesn't look we're a mature organization so yes this is the idea everyone now he can he or she would have an idea and will float it once we make them explain it to management so that the management will take decision let them then take it.

 I think that's the best course of action. And one more point.

Sheth, Kunal:
So see, as for HANA, they are not using the standard best practice. Even whenever we are creating a reservation, then automatically it will become a requirement for MRP calculation, right? So what they have done is they write a custom program. Automatically, whatever manual reservation or reservation which is created via work order, it is not considered for MRP. So they have disabled this functionality.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes, that's why when we're highlighting this we'll say stick to your old customized habits and okay we'll proceed but you're losing some of the benefits of IVP or these are the things you need to do not overnight but going forward so that you can get benefits and their job is to go check with Vignesh or with whomever guys why do we do this and can we undo or go to the best practice. Bushboy if you remember the reason behind this document we called insights and recommendation was this because there is no way on earth that this solution will just I mean whether we finish this one or UAT and go live that everything will be nice even they expected six month of hyper care but there are certain things that they need to decide from now are they changing their habits or not so that we know where to close the design we cannot have three designs it has to be and they accept.

 Kyle, before we close. Thanks, Mohammed. I just wanted to confirm a few things.

1Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
So I understand that the memo is going to be put on hold until this is all discussed. Yes, yes, yes. So then the end user identification template is also on hold until this has been discussed.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, no, no. Don't link them. End user identification for training. You're talking about the previous session, right? You can create that template. I think 80% of it, so drilling inventory, drilling supply, MRO inventory, MRO supply, chemicals inventory supply. I think the trouble area, even from a demand perspective, demand drilling, maybe if I understood, Raoul, it's almost confirmed the count. Demand chemicals not provided, but it should be okay.

 It's one of those intersections The MRO demand where you have an issue. So we don't need to freeze. Start building the framework. Let's populate what we have and could be one out of 15 cells is the TBD.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Yeah, so yes, yeah, correct. So we've got ad hoc onshore end users from Mohammed Ashik and Abdul Latif. I sent an email asking them for the remaining ones for the other companies that have drilling well. I didn't get a response and Nikita also sent a follow-up email and I raised that with Khaled today. So we're still waiting for those end-users and to your points about the MRO one, yes it's specific for this MRO demand.

 So then the authentication of these ones are essentially on hold at the moment.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, our agreement in the previous call stays as is. One of those numbers will be at question mark. Is it going to be 50 or 500 depending on where we stand? And then we'll fill it, but the rest is still as we discussed.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Fine, OK, but for the other ones, as I just mentioned, we have followed up a few times and I've raised it with Khaled.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, look, as we mentioned on the previous call and we told Hadi we'll make this critical as a risk in terms of identification. Yes, we're following up, maybe tomorrow, because today, for example, during the huddle, don't remember we mentioned the identification of count as a burning thing. Tomorrow we'll make sure it's the case. Adi and Raoul, if Kyle or Nikita aren't attending.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Okay guys. And then I just have two more points. I just have two more points. To Raoul, does this, the outcome of this, does this change the end user identification template for MRO demand?

Patel, Rahul:
It might. I cannot comment anything now unless we close this. It might.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes, this is the cell that we said will be TBD.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Yeah, yes, yes, I'm just making sure because we sent this template out already.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So if this is potentially going to change, I just need to be aware of this and then let them reply and then they will have been waiting forever on everything. If we sent something and then sent another query, it's fine. It's not the end of the world. Anyway, too late. You already sent it.

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
Sorry, just after Kyle. This point.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, special. Yeah, so more.

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
The approach was to send the template with the memo. So are we changing the approach now based on this? Because as I understand, all wants to Confirm this before sharing the memo.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But my understanding is that the memo the template has already been sent in terms of number of That's what Kyle just said, although the memo will be sent tomorrow, so they're not together.

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
The template was sent to Tareh, who was supposed to share it with the memo.

Patel, Rahul:
That was the plan.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Yes, but it's been agreed that that MRO demand is on hold right now, so that won't be sent out to these MRO guys until this issue is sorted out.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Memo should be on hold. Whatever template with it or not. Our building that Excel sheet or whatever you want to call it that shows how many of the intersections we know the count versus not is what I'm saying. Let's build it ASAP, please. Today when I asked what is our state of the union, we don't have one summary sheet that says for the following intersection per group company, business line and function.

 This is what we have. Let's build this. With whatever we have right now, Bashir and Kyle, and then we'll complement it as we go. Let's not link everything. At least assume I'm ad-hoc management. I'll tell you, I'll help you. Show me where you have gaps. If we don't have the summary, let's create it on Excel.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Let's not overdo it on a slide or looking fancy. Okay? Okay. I have one more question. The communication for enterprise asset management, does this change that you've just discussed Does this have any implication on that communication?

Naamani, Mohamad:
I don't know what you're referring to.

Patel, Rahul:
Are you referring to the PPT?

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
Yes. And the memo, everything is linked now.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
OK, because that's also been seen outside ASMA, so OK, I need you to be aware of that. But it's up to ASMA only, correct?

Patel, Rahul:
And we are going to align with ASMA and TEM only, so it's not sent to end-user EM community as of now.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah, okay. Yes, I'm just making sure I'm a lot.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah, it was said before before this. Let's say These these new requirements came up, yes Okay. Yeah, thanks. And anyway, Kyle and Nikita.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I think you have the morning call I'm sending it again with Khalid and Asim I'm sending you the whole series tomorrow might be an interesting part to join or interesting time and to join, and then for the rest, it will be on demand, but at least you'll have the invite. This way you'll hear it from the horse's mouth. You'll hear it from the horse's mouth, and based on it will decide, okay?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, thank you.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I agree. Bye everyone, thank you. Thank you. Have a nice day. Thank you all. Thank you.
