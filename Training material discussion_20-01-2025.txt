Madhavan, Tara:
So, basically the reason for setting up this discussion is to have an idea of how the material will be ready and how we can progress. Let's wait for Hadi and maybe somebody from OACM team also to join, okay?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Rocio is the only one invited.

Madhavan, Tara:
Yeah, yeah, she's joined.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello, Tara.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Meanwhile, may I ask you to find the training strategy? Document because we Yeah, of course.

Madhavan, Tara:
There is an item that I have included that is called a day in the life of We need to discuss that point also in today's.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Sorry, I couldn't.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi honey.

Rocio Minguillon:
I couldn't understand you that.

Madhavan, Tara:
I just said that there is a task added in the tracker that says day in the life of So, we need to cover that point also in today's meeting.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I will explain. Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So, guys, shall we start now? Hadi has joined, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So, essentially, I think I'll try to simplify our exercise as much as I can. So we've got three processes, right? Demand we've got a few variants in supply we also have a few variants um so now from the materials perspective I think we've got these two um major groups of materials so one being ppt which will be used for the for the training right so we'll also have a user guide or user manual which will be probably word-based then PPT is PPT it's clear each of the materials will have a specific structure and specific standard or like quality, right?

 Requirements, so each of those. So now we need to plan how and when we develop it, right? Who will be developing it? So we need, yeah, for each you'll probably need responsibility and dates.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Responsibility and dates.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I think this is the exercise we need to run now. Any questions, any comments, any ideas?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, the only thing is that for choosing which material are we doing for each of the processes and the variants, I would like to I would like to have that task to review it with my team. And so we can define that. I mean, I don't think that's necessary to have a meeting, just we can do it like internally and share it. But regarding responsibilities and dates, okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So, okay, let's split it into a few sections, right? Section one will be for you guys to have a look at the structure of the process variants and share with us if like how would you see the structure of the of the courses because I think we can have a part of the material general for demand right but then as soon as we go into specific variants like drilling chemicals and MRO we might create additional material for specific courses on that because they are very different, right?

 Users are different, forms are different, the structure of the data is different, and the process.

Rocio Minguillon:
Exactly, and what was the result of the training needs analysis? It was something related to that or finally it wasn't?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Look, training needs analysis is very dependent on the user groups, right? And we're still in the process of collecting the users and key users. So this is why we are a bit stuck with it, but it doesn't stop us from planning the development, right?

Rocio Minguillon:
Of course, it was just to know if that was useful. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And also, just for you to know, training needs analysis is also focusing on things like, where the users are located for example are we really able to consider room training or we have to only arrange teams because the guys are sitting somewhere in the platform in the offshore you know stuff like that then Arabic versus English then training needs like the things like back-to-backs if they're having their peer like if they're working in shifts for example then we'll also need to kind of identify that need, right?

 Then computer literacy shouldn't be an issue as per our initial research, but those kind of things, a bit wider than the actual training material structure, yeah? Just for you to know, Rocio. Perfect, thank you. Okay, so this will be the first exercise you guys will be doing. The second one, have a look at this, right? At the header and just confirm you are fine with this and you have no questions and then we'll get down to specific details for each.



Rocio Minguillon:
What is the difference between the short video and the video PPT-based?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
This will be more like engaging video, a very short overview, not going too deep and this will be a full-scope PPT recording. Okay. This will be placed for the safe-paced learning if somebody needs to upskill themselves to remember something. They might prefer a video, right? If the user is well-equipped, he understands everything but there is a specific question, then they might use detailed manual user guide in Word.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Perfect. Okay. Yes.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And then the third component would be to, based on the project plan, to see who is doing what and when, including two iterations of review because it's always the case. Consultants prepare something, change team and business review it. There are some gaps that needs to be covered, some improvements that need to be there, right? So let's provide for two iterations of review and ideally each iteration will not take more than one week.

 So, it's basically two weeks. How much time do we have for material development? Five? Five weeks, right?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, so...

Rocio Minguillon:
So, we can already put dates for that. I can...

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, let's put three weeks for initial development. Well, ideally, with some of the modules, we'll need to start delivering them earlier. So I would say we would split into week one modules, week two modules, week three modules, and then two weeks for review. For review and improvements.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
All right, so this will be the third piece of the exercise before we discuss it in details.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Rocio Minguillon:
Is that fine, Rocio? Yes, yes, yes. Can we include this first activity of defining the structure of the topics or structure of the content?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This one? Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, can we add just one activity that said that just to put dates on everything? Oh, excuse me. Say it again. To add activity where? And there, like in the... Here, like in light blue. Like the column C. Like just to keep it here. In row one. In the row one. Yeah, what do I need to do? Define a task that should be define a structure of the content. Structure of the content.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean as you're putting there. It's already here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, I was just saying like to put it as an activity.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Here in blue. Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay. No problem. Like this, right? Yes, yes, perfect.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, is there anything else that we should know regarding the preparation now of the content? I mean, the formats?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Formats, we need the templates, we need formats, we need, we'll probably try to draft something like standards or quality requirements, like which I mentioned here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Right, before we start, and then, what else? I had something in my mind. We will set up a tracker for training materials development. And we'll be, yeah, we'll be catching up with you with certain cadence and just check how guys are doing, if we are on track, if everything is fine, because sometimes training material development becomes the last priority, right? Yes. A question from my side, Nikita.



Roumanos, Hadi:
Yes, Hadi. A question from my side. Is the exercise of working on the schedule of those trainings happening in parallel. So this is something that Tara can help with, along with Rocio. So you're talking content right now, mostly. My brain is thinking when things are happening. So this is an exercise that's separate from this one, but I'm assuming it will be conducted by Tara and Rocio together, just to make sure we know when these trainings are happening and make sure that the right people are

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
involved. Yeah. Okay. Okay, fine. For key user training, yes. Because key user training, as I remember the plan, it is following the training material development.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I just wanted to make sure we have that alignment on the strategy approach with Khaled as soon as we can. Maybe it's worth having a discussion with Mohamed before that. Just to make sure that we have all the right understanding of who's getting trained, how, between key users and end users. This is important, right? So that we can avoid surprises later on down the road. If you want us to have a chat with Mohamed before, then we can easily get on the call, all three of us, including Rocio, if needed, just to make sure that at least internally we're aligned, and then we go

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
to Khalid together. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the plan. So the three slides that we are developing with Bshare, we'll need to discuss them internally before going to Holid 100%. All right. All right.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sounds good.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Because we also, as per proposal, we have a lot of admin tasks sitting with AdNoc. So we'll have to talk it through with Halid and make sure that he understands the magnitude of it. And I think things like setting invites, you know, figuring out the schedule, it's also a lot with AdNoc. So let us specify, right, which tasks are with KPMG, which tasks are with AdNoc, and then we will discuss it together as well, yeah, before going to Halid.

 Because for each of the tasks sitting with AdNoc, we'll need to fire a responsible person from them. Like, who is going to send invites, right? Who is going to confirm the schedule? Who is going to track attendance and all that sort of stuff? It's a lot of tasks, to be honest, altogether.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right.

Rocio Minguillon:
But that's separate from this. Okay. So we should also consider that activity of defining the templates. And the format of the videos.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
No, I think. Templates, yeah, let me take it down here. Yeah, for all of this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Template formats, yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, so for the structure of the content, let me see the dates. We are starting this development of the material on the week of the 10th of February. So maybe our target, like for all of us, of having that structure of the content aligned should be the 31st of January.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So for us...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
You mean this one, yeah?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Does it sound good to you?

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean... Yeah, it makes sense.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
So we have one week to... Yeah. Yes, okay. Okay, and for the template and all that, it's important to be ready at seven, because we're supposed to start.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, so yeah, we need to agree with Khaled before you guys start, so that we don't rework, right? We don't move it to a different template. Yes, I know. Specifically for this too, right?

Rocio Minguillon:
Because videos are recorded based on this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, that's true. That's true.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
This has to be seven months of fad. Yeah. And as well as.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Probably the same. Yes.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Because videos will be, yeah, we'll plan, but I guess you guys will be recording videos like last two weeks of, last two weeks of this five-week cycle, yeah? We'll see how. How good we are before the review and improvements and then.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
Perfect. Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And probably. Yeah. And we need we really need to think when we need this video. Because we might not really need it in the beginning, like by the start of the course. Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
That's also something I mean, the definition of the strategy of the of the training for will have an impact here. I mean, it's not a blocker because, I mean, we still have to create the PPTs and the user guides, but it's better to know how it's going to be.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
It's also more aimed at end-users. This is more for end-users, right, than for key users. Let us think how to optimally plan our time to not overload ourselves right in the beginning. Maybe we'll be developing videos a bit later. Maybe even after the key user training, when we'll have received the feedback from them, saying, look guys, this is what we like, this is what would improve, and then we would improve the material and record the video for the end users, probably.

 That would be the right way forward, the right way forward. All right, anything else, any comments from anyone, Tara, Hadi, Bisher?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, not from me.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So we agreed to meet up, we agreed to meet up when? End of this week, beginning Beginning of next week, right? Beginning of next week, probably. Or also, right? And we see like what the detailed plan will be.

Rocio Minguillon:
And then we'll draft it. No, it's the end of the next week, but this week we can, yeah, we can review it.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I mean, the 31st is next week, but today is 20. Yeah, so we also need tracker templates.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, of course. The place where we are doing this. Yeah, it must be the SharePoint that we have together.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you can see our progress. Yeah. SharePoint. Yep.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
All right, cool. Anything else? Bishar, any observations, any ideas? No, I think it's all good from my side. Cool, then let's finish. Let me distribute this working Excel with everyone and let's follow the plan. Rocio, if you could share an invite. For our review end of this week, beginning of next week, it will be cool.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, okay, okay, sure. Perfect, perfect. And okay, when you have the slides for the end user strategy, let us know and we can also... What do you mean slides for end user strategy?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
No, no, the three slides. Oh, I see, I see, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, definitely. We'll share with everyone. Thank you guys.

Madhavan, Tara:
So, who's picking up the next meeting?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Rocio.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I will.

Madhavan, Tara:
Okay. All right. All right. Thanks. Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Thanks, everyone. Have a good day. Thank you.
