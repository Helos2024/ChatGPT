UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Kunal. Yeah, hi.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Everyone. I could go.

Sheth, Kunal:
I could.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I guess. I think. I am.

Naamani, Mohamad:
you Who is this call with and for pending issue?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Do we have something pending or it's just recurring? So this call happens twice weekly.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, I remember, but I mean, we're only joining the GoaCM team. Is there something that we need from them? Then we should try to call them even on the phone.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
We're the only party that... Based on yesterday's huddle, we decided that during this, we're going to take this call to go over the supply planning tie-in, BPD.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Can someone, how did you want it to ping the go SCM team on the channel?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Um, I can bring them. Give me a minute.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Who do you need?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Who do we absolutely need? Marshall and Hector. Let me. Yeah, we can ask him about Western.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I acted. Morning.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Good morning slash afternoon.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Good, I think the team was checking if also Bastian would join or you will cover. I'll let them align.

Hector Palacios:
if you have all the info.

Sheth, Kunal:
I think we can start based on the comments put up by the Jagannath for supply plan time so it is around eight comments he has specified and the spelling mistakes which he mentioned that that is more of a I don't see any issue for the spelling grammatical part but especially for the processes which is not in line with the time discussion which we had so there we can see the concern so this is one where we can see the spelling this as per the right one only so One is here, adjustments are required for the approved supply plan.

 This is also there. So Mo, I think here, do you see any, Mo Fakhoury, do you see any, I don't think, I don't know why.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So from a process perspective, the agreement was that the process will be similar to the one in the ones we have for chemicals and they were and they were okay with this this is during and even during the discussions for drilling they mentioned that they it's going to be similar to chemicals so it's this is where you know it's a bit confusing they're saying that no this is not aligned with what they want.



Hector Palacios:
That's what I said. I remember that more because this was raised very late and we were saying this basically and they said no but this is going to be very simple. That's what I remember and with the same idea what we did for like planning at least is exactly chemicals.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Maybe there's no one the stuff they are raising but I don't know exactly so from from Italian perspective it's it's either that they load the demand or it goes by you know goes through historical consumption they can they can also manually adjust it adjust the demand and then it goes through a round of approval We're focusing on the supply planning, right? The questions are related to supply planning and not demand, right?

 Correct. So yeah, for supply planning, yeah, it's because they said that they don't do, they don't have any, it's not VMI managed, so it's gonna go through like regular uh you know replenishment yeah so probably let's reply to go through

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
the comments one by one now collaborate with vendor when you say hector or anyone when we say collaborate with vendor which means that we are talking about the stocking policy which is uh for how much period they want to keep the inventory in the stock right So is it collaboration with vendor or it is stocking policy?

Sheth, Kunal:
Because here it is giving you the wrong information. Collaboration with vendor means we are using Ariba somewhere.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
But we are not talking about Ariba here. So can you clarify?

Hector Palacios:
What do you mean here? I see glory with vendor.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I will check with us if he write that I will check Yeah, next I think collaborate collaborate with vendor would be useful for drilling because that's VMI But if it's not VMI, we're they're not necessarily collaborating with vendors unless

Hector Palacios:
it's If you ask me that's some like benefits of IVP like high level.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And they are just a general term you're saying? Yeah.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So maybe then probably we need to clarify it better. What do we mean by collaborate? Because he's assuming that like he's not clear what we mean by collaborate with vendor.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So Hector, do you think we can change it to stocking policy instead of collaborate with vendor?

Hector Palacios:
I need to see better the context of that because I don't know if that is before the process after the process, you know. So let me check what he was putting there and why.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Sheth, Kunal:
So I think let us park this for some time till the time Hector joins. Let us move to the next. Tendering process, visibility of PR in order to be ready for the new supplier. So PR for new supplier.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Can you go to process once for this point? Process flow you mean to say?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, process flow. Here we have said call of order, PR, and STR. This is correct.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So from a PR perspective, we know that if it is an agreement, then it is call of order. And if there is no agreement, then it's a PR through tendering.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So if we now, with respect to this, go back to the point which was mentioned there. What are we referring to tendering process here? The focus only on the tendering process, but it's not only tendering process, right? We have both call of agreement as well as PR and PR will go through tendering process. So I think this is referring to what we've mentioned in drilling as well. Similar thing, right?

 Because this is a copy of drilling. So here Hector will need a clarification whether why just tendering process is mentioned it should be both tendering as well as call-off right so when it is a long-term agreement it's call-off agreement call-off and when there's PR it just

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
it goes through the tendering process maybe here instead tendering process visibility of PRs that do not have a call-off order Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Do you want to make this change or do you want me to add this sentence? Visibility of PRs that do not have a call of order.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Visibility of PR do not Visibility, so essentially we can say that if there is a long-term agreement available, then the call of order would be used if the long-term agreement is not available. But do we want to say it under tenting process? Do we even want to refer tenting process here? Because essentially it's PR, STR, and Because the title is not in line. Yeah, so the point itself is not in line, because we have supplied second bullet, right?

 We recommend PR, STR and call of agreement. The proposals are basically PR, STR or call of agreement.

Bastian Osorio:
We should not even refer to the rendering process.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Hi everyone. Yeah.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Let's go back to the first point.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So the question here is what we mean by collaborate with vendor here with respect to time.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
So this is this one is related, I mean, to the to the to drilling. I thought the same process as they have with for drilling for VMI on all that is also applied to time in.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Is not applicable for time, right? Yeah, so it's it's not yet. That's not what they have in the current state, but they're not as, let's say, mature as the drilling process for tie-in to have VMI. They said they might be in the future to look into VMI for tie-in process, but currently everything is managed by So I think then we can remove that part.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
There's no collaboration with the vendors.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
OK, so we simply remove it along with the comment here. What should we do here? Because I don't want to give this message.

Hector Palacios:
the comment and remove the sentence. We can see clearly there, we remove it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
So you can edit the whole text, Kunal, and leave a space. So if you leave a space, the comment stays, you know? Now we're inside the...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, like that. Oops, it's deleted. OK.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Maybe before A, add the space and then remove the space. Remove A

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You're done.

Sheth, Kunal:
Collaborative with vendor is not relevant for time process, right? I don't want to put this comment here saying that it's not relevant because then this was discussed.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Then simply question us saying that then why it was that to start with that's what I was thinking what should be the reply here I don't want to give this message that this is something we thought is similar to

Sheth, Kunal:
drilling or otherwise shall we go to the comment first and then we will decide for a updation part.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
The same point is applicable for the next point as well. Tendering process is not relevant for... Is this with the same assumption? That it is similar to the link?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
So in case they don't have a supplier, how is it going to happen?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So that's something we will cover in the supply planning proposal, right?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So we have PR, STR, and call of agreement, right? So if it is a supplier is there, we have an agreement, and we simply a call of agreement.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
If there is no call of agreement, the PR will be created and then they will identify the supplier as the normal process.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Does that make sense?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So, should we remove this point, then this point as well? Vasanth, you okay with me removing this point?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So now let's take out the tendering process and then here you reply that. Tendering PR for new supplier as per the is created. Is created. Created when there is no LTP. What do you call it?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Long-term agreement. LTP.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
When LTP is not available.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
We understand when the PR is created, it goes through the rendering process.

Bastian Osorio:
But again, the question is, what if there is no supplier for a material?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
The PR will get created. Without the supplier, right? Without source of supply. If you remember all the conversations, in general, in the supply planning, in AdNoc, they go through, so we have three scenarios. If we go back to the discussion, one, they have LTPA, then it's straightforward that we know the vendor and we know the LTPA and we'll raise a call of agreement against LTPA. Now, if it is not a LTPA, then it creates a PR.

 Now, within PR, there are two things, whether we know the vendor or whether we don't know the vendor. Now, whether we know the vendor depends upon the repeat order. If it is within one year of the planning process, then the repeat order is placed on the same vendor. If it is beyond one year, then it goes to the tendering process, which means there is no vendor available and the vendor gets confirmed after the tendering process.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This is applicable to all the supply planning processes of ADNOC.

Bastian Osorio:
Are we aligned here, Bastian?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So with this understanding, the comment is that if PR is created, if the LTP is not available, we understand if the PR is created, it goes through the tendering process if the supplier is identified. We understand that PR goes through the tendering process to identify the supplier.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So we not say new supplier, supplier.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
It can be new, it can be existing, right? If it is standard, then whoever is a supplier can have.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right. Is it fine?

Sheth, Kunal:
and this we need to delete right I think let's keep this okay because then it supports the point of tendering process and here what we need to write for the first point collaborate with vendors even here I am Let's

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
keep this open, come back to this, we'll come back to this point. Okay. We can just mention basically what we understood without saying that it's not, like, saying that tie-in inventory is managed by AdNoc, therefore, Yeah, just without that. Inventory for tie-in process inventory is managed by ad-hoc updated. What do you think, Raoul?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Collaborate with vendor. We can say that collaboration with vendor. We let's keep that the text as well and say that and say that collaborate with vendor meant is the lead time in from an inventory perspective. How much lead time we need to carry, right?

Sheth, Kunal:
I think collaborative trend that we have just deleted do one way to.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, bring that again. Yeah, bring that point back.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Control Z.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I think if I'm doing control Z then this will get deleted.

Sheth, Kunal:
No just add a new bullet point.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Copy this comment from the And then sponsored.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So, here we can mention is collaborate with Menderwin's assigning, having inventory policy, defining inventory policy. Defining lead times.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, defining lead times in terms of the stock, like lead times of the stock to be can. So essentially what we are saying is that, let's relate this to the point where we've agreed that they will carry inventory for specific material vendor combination, maybe for a period of six months or one year, right? So this inventory in terms of periods of inventory or weeks of inventories or months of inventories is what they will carry, right?

 So let's relate it to that point.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Inventory policy in terms of how many months of inventory to be carried. Of months of a number of months of inventory.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
To be planned.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
In supply planning.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
for a given vendor material vendor combination for a given material vendor combination okay collaborative vendor can we put this combination Inventory policy is not directly linked with material vendor. Ultimately, we'll have to maintain for a material, right? If we have to consider the bleed time planning for a material.

Bastian Osorio:
So, Bastian, Hector, does this comment make sense in terms of...

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
OK, then let's post this comment so that. And then the second comment we already had put it back.

Hector Palacios:
Are these two common guys or is there more than this?

Sheth, Kunal:
There are eight comments are there, then we are complete.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, we check the comment first before answering because otherwise we are not going to progress.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah, I just want to make sure because I don't know if Jagannath went through the whole document because I think he stopped at one point. So we just need to make sure that, you know, the rest of the document aligns with With the current after paid number 10, we don't have additional comment Okay, yeah, so next is this related to time when it was

Bastian Osorio:
discussed Yeah, this is the same then drilling Again it's the same comment that the assumption was that basically the drilling process is also applicable to tie-in.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
But I don't think we've discussed the drilling process for the applicable tie-in. We clearly said that the trying process is independent planning by end-user and then It's not similar to the link and it's a standard supply planning.

Bastian Osorio:
So, reservation, is there, are there reservation?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, reservation would be there for sure because without reservation you cannot consume material, right? So, that's the standard process of creating reservation for consumption of So here probably we can reply. Okay, this is one comment, so we don't want to reply, right? Let's go through the next comment. Is this comment relevant, first thing, and do you think this short-term planning is relevant considering the consumption of metal is a standard process?



Bastian Osorio:
So, we can always say that this comment is not related to standard preservation, it is related to the we're using for drilling.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
But drilling also, we don't have a separate reservation time, right?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
It's just a reservation is to consume metal from the stock.

Bastian Osorio:
That's what we're saying here.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So I think that we can, We can then say that this is the consumption of material once it is available in stock, the process of consuming material.

Bastian Osorio:
This comment is related to, it's just considering It's the standard reservation, basically, but from the well site, the rig site. So when the reserve material is to be used in the rig site.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
OK, so I think this comment is probably the statement what we have mentioned, the content is relevant. But we need to help Jagannath understand that this is something is the standard for self-consuming material and the assumption here is the tying metal will also get consumed at the rig side or the well side physically. Correct question? Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, let's move to the next point then.

Sheth, Kunal:
Next is spelling. Material reservation. What is the problem with the spelling?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So I did update a lot of the Spelling mistakes.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
OK, so it was a spelling mistake before, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let's close them down. So more in parallel.

Sheth, Kunal:
Can you close that spelling part? Go to the next one, not clear.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Mid to long term plan is not clear to Jagannath.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I'm going to activate also track changes because it wasn't activated.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This is very standard.

Bastian Osorio:
This is not, it doesn't say nothing. Cannot be applicable to tie in.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I also agree.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Let's explain this to them not separately. Let's go to the next comment. What is the next comment?

Sheth, Kunal:
This is also is this related to time when it was discussed?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Click what's that?

Bastian Osorio:
It's just additional attributes.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Not clear. OK, next spelling.

Bastian Osorio:
Additional attributes for each of the master data must be defined by key users so they can be integrated into the system.

Sheth, Kunal:
This is the last one, probably. And this is also spelling.

Bastian Osorio:
Well, I thought it was not clear.

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, it's done from Jagannath.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So let's pick this up. I think the way I think we should do is we'll explain this to Jagannath. Probably we'll have a call with Jagannath. Let's try to explain this. Bastian, Hector, do you want to join that call or do you want us to go ahead and have that conversation with Jagannath? Sorry, what was the question? So it seems like Jagannath is having some misunderstanding. I recommend that we can have a quick half 15 minute or half an hour call with Jagannath to explain him.

 Why we mentioned what we mentioned it's not understood to him let's clarify his thoughts and if he's aligned we can reply back to the team saying that the document is as per what we have discussed so would you guys would like to join the call with jagannath sure okay let me talk to them and probably plan for a 15 minute call with him to align on this document when do you want to make this call I'll check with him, and probably today only I'll have this call with him.

 Let me confirm the team on his availability. Let me check it right away while we continue. Sebastian, the comments are answered, but in general, the feedback that you do not have clarity of time process. Do you still have any questions which are open from you in terms of understanding of time process, which we if we can try to address will address but if we all feel that there is that it needs more clarity then when we talk to Jagannath will also add for will also ask for this clarity.



Bastian Osorio:
Yeah I sent a list of questions and you answered to those questions but of course not I think with not a very deep level of detail so I think we can take that that list of questions and just confirm with him all the points.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Let me pull up that email from you which I have answered so that we can go through it.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
I'm just looking for the team. Ram, it was, I think, you sent to Bashir.

Sheth, Kunal:
So you need to check in your outbox.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
That's what I'm doing. Let me, I got the email, let me share my screen. This is the questions you had. So all time materials, how can we identify? Time materials are in as far as they have submitted everything we need to check this. So in the last technical call we have concluded this right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How will we identify tying metal? Hector, you were there in the call.

Hector Palacios:
Yes, so we go to the storage location, but there is not like there is not like a big flag on the material level but there on the storage location.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
There are some specific storage locations that say Portain in the description, so we can use that. Okay. You clear question about this question?

Bastian Osorio:
So we cannot identify all like, Only type in materials they are part of dream and correct. There's no way to differentiate them.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
At a material level, correct? They are telling that telling us that we need to.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
The only way there they are different today is they have a separate location for planning and the Mardi table logic where if the material is extended to the tying location, then those materials are for tying, planning for tying. They have provided, there are around seven or eight locations, twelve locations which are related to tying.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Can we identify the plants that are a part of tying process? So, our understanding is that The plans for tying are same as for drilling because tying is one of the sub process of drilling as in business. There are no separate plans for tying.

Bastian Osorio:
Also, in the last technical call, the team confirmed tying is applicable only for onshore and not for offshore. Onshore? Just onshore?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Just onshore. Okay.

Bastian Osorio:
And sour gas?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Sour gas? Not even sour gas, just onshore.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Will the supply lead time and vendor-managed inventory be integrated?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Supply lead time and standard delivery time materials do not have VMI.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Do you have any further clarity required on this?

Bastian Osorio:
No, you explained already that in case of there, if there's no vendor, then we should create the PR.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, yeah, but in terms of VMI, it was clearly agree that there is no VMI for time.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
At which level demand is defined?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Is it to plant MRP or sequence level? So this was also discussed and it was clear that demand is at plant level, material plant combination, and or material plant storage location combination. This was discussed in the last technical meeting as well. Demand is not based on completion code, it's like chemicals.

Bastian Osorio:
And what about the well?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Well is not, demand is also not related to well. It's a plant and plant and storage location level only.

Bastian Osorio:
Just at plant level?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yes, so you can define plant and storage locations since there are specific time specific storage locations.

Bastian Osorio:
Okay, so the wells are not relevant to the process then? Yeah, it is like chemicals only, right?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
We discussed in the call as well that But it is not well-based planning. It's directly metal-based planning.

Bastian Osorio:
No, but Chemicals has the equipment and the functional location.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
No, but Chemicals also direct demand planning, right? We are not relating to the equipment. Equipments are related to MRO.

Bastian Osorio:
For traceability purposes, we do have the And we're integrating the demand at equipment level. A product location, location, well, storage, location and equipment. OK, you are adding the top.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You're saying something, Chris book.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yes, I'm saying do we want to quickly look at the bomb template if you want to up in the meeting?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, we have the meeting in 15 minutes. Let's go through, let's quickly go through the points. We'll not spend time and then we'll look at the BOM template. Okay. So we're clear here, right? On at which level the planning happens?

Bastian Osorio:
Then there is no, there is no well, there is no equipment, there is no, there is just material and is it planned? Is it or is it storage location?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
We discussed yesterday's Tuesday's technical call. This is plant and storage locations. Plant, okay. Since time activity is applicable for a well, well information attribute should be available for linking. Are we connecting the demand to a specific well? Since time activity is applicable for a well, well information as an attribute should be available. It's not like dealing with demand is driven by well plan.

 So this is what I had also shared that. So and we can clarify this point with the dealing team or tying team saying that do you even want the well as an attribute not from a planning perspective but just an additional attribute for which wells Similar to what

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
you mentioned about the equipment, right? The well is basically our consumption point.

Hector Palacios:
So yeah, I mean, the standard is to have it by consumption point. I don't know if they will need that.

Bastian Osorio:
And if we want to load historical the historical consumption and if they have the data. I mean, I don't think they have the data at well because they don't have the welding in Esrohana.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So I think they have the historical consumption at WBS level. Are specific to wealths.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How frequently demand forecasts are adjusted monthly or quarterly? So we said monthly or quarterly.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Is there any transaction that needs to be integrated? Yes, same as historical consumption, material derivation, open PR, PO. Inventory planning. Similar to when they have an inventory plan, inventory in months, period-based inventory. Should the system consider movement between the plant? Yes, we need to check with the knock-on.

Bastian Osorio:
No, but is there any standardized policy for safety stock and reorder point calculation?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
No, I don't think there is any standardized policy for safety stock and reorder point calculation. What we understood in the meeting was they carry inventory for a period of one year.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Or six months.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Or six months from the point of consumption.

Hector Palacios:
In that regard, it's like two years.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so it's period-based inventory planning and not inventory parameter-based planning.

Hector Palacios:
That's the way it's going to be all related to waste, because they say that maybe they are not using the well for this. I think that the well plan, they are using it as a reference. But the point is that all this information of WorldPlan is very dynamic, so calculating a forecast, safety stocks, it's not applicable.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Correct, and the WorldPlan, the reference is there, what they use and they will directly provide the input as demand, right? So we don't need to worry about linking the demand of time to the well plan. Supply planning, then this is what a moment between plant. Yes, we need to check whether they How they want to capture the moment between plant should wear this and how they communicate either which are used to issue material we discussed in the call as well the main consideration for PR.

 So this is what is the main consideration for creation of PR we already discussed right LTP a call of agreements. This is also specific. So. Based upon this information, do you still need additional input? Bastion. You have open questions.

Bastian Osorio:
We do have more questions. Can you share this more questions so that we know that if you go down?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Who are the stakeholders for responsible planning time? We've identified their time planners. Who is responsible for collaboration and approval in the process we identified. This is a time manager and time planner. Who is responsible purchase planning of an approval with the centralized inventory planning team? Are there any specific KPIs? This is something which we'll get to know in the supply planning in the in the in the build discussion, right?

 Similar to every other process.

Hector Palacios:
Nowhere we've asked for specific KPIs. Yeah, yeah, so. What we need to do right now is following the we will need to plan the unit testing for this as well but this is more related to the planning so we have time so we will need to ask for the data for them as well so they've already provided time data in the excel sheet the time sheet but but that is not all the data we will need to ask for lead time for all that kind of stuff

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
yes so so let me know if you have So that's what the point is. If we have open questions, let's discuss internally what all further open questions are required. If we know we have input, we'll try to help each other.

Hector Palacios:
And if there is something which we need from AdNoc, then we'll approach AdNoc. When we start seeing the data, the questions are going to become very clear. It's much easier.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So let's do one thing. The data which provides time Excel sheet planning sheet is provided by AdNoc. Can we leverage that to check what information is available?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, we can check the forecast and all of that.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
And whatever information is not available we'll go back to AdNoc and ask that this is what we need originally from the data you provided.

Hector Palacios:
No, but we need to check the list right away. I mean it's for sure that it's a demand forecast file so all the information related to the pipeline is going to be missing so we need to ask to be in niche and they will see how they deliver that

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
information because they I don't know yeah it's not even internally they are pre-aligned on the filters you know yeah so so you're talking about supply planning right but currently the the demonstration or the unit testing we are doing for demand and inventory right so from immediate need do you have any data requirement let's try to to address that first, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. OK.

Hector Palacios:
For me, the important point is the is demand planning, sorry, is supply planning. I think for demand planning, there remains that this is going to be very simple, like just a manual input. So I wouldn't create any session for that. I would put a supply planning session in the future when we go with the unit testing for supply planning and make sure that we understand everything for them.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so from a supply planning perspective, if you can identify what all data is required, you can share the templates for supply planning the way we did for MRO and everything else, right? So if you have the templates, then we'll ask the data.

Hector Palacios:
Mostly the same, so we are going to take one of the ones that we already sent and just recycle that.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so just make sure that whatever data is provided for time, if we can leverage any of the data if it is available, then we should use that first and then ask for additional data from AdNoc. So one last question on time. Bastian and Hector, before we go back to AdNoc and say that we've reviewed the document and it's ready for approval, can you once again look at the supply planning document and make sure that it's not related to the link at all.

 And based upon our discussion, you feel comfortable to make sure that the time document from supply planning is correct?

Bastian Osorio:
Yes, let me check when I do have time to review it again because… No, no, no.

Hector Palacios:
Guys, here, please help us. Please help us. It's something that you can also can help us there. We have many activities related to configuration and we need to push that in We are just ready for the integration, so we need to put all our time on that, and it's going to help us take other more important decisions on this. So, if you can take this, it's just to review if this is related to the IENO drilling.



Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
We don't need technical expertise on this, please.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Okay. Kunal, can we sit together, or can you have a look at it? The time token based on our discussion and if there are any specific questions highlighted to the team.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Sure, I can book some time the three of us to go.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
After this technical call we can get into the call to complete the time.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So, let's switch quickly to the technical related discussion. Kushbu, you want to present?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So, what time is the technical call because I don't have a in the next five minutes, so let me send that to you.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
One, two, three.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
So, Baxin and Hector, I'm assuming that we do not have any open questions from a process or from a solution prospect for time, right? We don't need to go back, other than if there are any data-related questions, but we don't need to go back to AdNoc for any question-specific time. Is this correct?

Bastian Osorio:
I mean, we have a basic understanding of the process of course that there is a lot of complexities that for sure they are not addressed in this first document but I understand that they will not be addressed now but during the building phase, unit testing, UAT, so on and so forth.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah so where we are standing at the current stage would you need additional information to proceed with is what the question is.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah we will need for sure because it I don't know if this by nature is a very simple process let's hope that it the case but if you compare with the information that we have for MRO chemicals for you know for drilling is much much poor you know it's poorer the information so it's what we have let's go with something very simple and then I guess that we can start putting more complexity on this yeah so then that's

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
what I'm with the information what we have we can proceed right that's the question we don't need Yeah, with a very basic, yes, approach.

Hector Palacios:
It's going to be a very basic approach like everyone here is thinking, but that is my concern, you know? Maybe they just did it very basic because the race is at the end, but let's check. Yeah, yeah. But let's assume.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
And then that's what we'll show to them.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
And if there are any further inputs during build, then we'll take those input as we get.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, no, no, yeah. I mean, the best approach is what Basti is saying all the time is let's take data, let's do something with their data and let's iterate from there.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
That's going to be the best. Okay. So guys, we just had a call in the morning with Vignesh and what Vignesh recommended is to have a quick template created, which Khushbu has created. Khushbu, can you share the template?

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
I'm sharing my screen, can you see?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
OK, so what I've done is for this filter lowers our cone water injector type. I've also taken category slot recovery and completion code to be. These are the two worms that I have just listed as an example. One with the total quantity of almost 19998 and the other is 2042. OK, so like I said, this is the combination that we have. And these becomes then our components.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
But then we need to...

Hector Palacios:
We spot some cases in which the category was like the same and we even have different component quantities. So, the category is something that we discarded, like an additional component that is bringing more combinations, you know. The currency that we align with business as well is that this is where field is the field that will type the completion code. And there should be an indicator for completion code, but anything like that, anything additional, we don't know.

 And maybe casing, but here we don't have anything related to casing information.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so the point is that we need to show what information we have. And say that, based upon this information, this is what is making sense.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Is this OK? Yeah, yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
So in this example also, we have- Rahul, we showed that in the last session. We actually have loaded the data in the system. But I mean, this is funny. If this is for easier understanding for them, it's fine. But this is exactly what we showed in the last session.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so that's what, Vignesh, we'll back was rather than showing them the technical templates of IBP, he's saying that let's show only this information which makes more sense so that at least we get some sample data from them.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
And then as we get more data, we will get into details.

Bastian Osorio:
I understand, but I feel we're not progressing here. Because as you know, we shared the question, we shared the template, with Abdullatif, we make the question and at this point we should have the answers. I don't know why we're having, I don't know, fifth session to ask the same questions again. We are not asking this question, we are just getting ready.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
We hope that as per our last discussion, today we will have the answers. That's what we discussed, right? And for that...

Hector Palacios:
I think Abdullatif was going to take a template for this, right? So he was writing on the same session, he said for the next session we are going to have it.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Yeah so we are just keeping this as additional readiness if Abdul Latif is not able to manage to define a template based upon our description at least we know what we need.

Hector Palacios:
Did you identify that for different categories sometimes you have different bones everything else the same you know?

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah for sure there are issues with the sheet we don't have everything that we need but we can definitely come up amount of data or some bombs with the information that we do have available, I think.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, but I just want to know if the category is adding an additional layer of information or is just redundant, you know? It is, so if... What we think is that it's redundant, but if you found some examples in which it's adding more information, then yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let's see.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
So, Kusum, the only feedback here is in the sheet, you split the sheet into two sheets, as we discussed with Vignesh, right? The two sheets is first, first two rows is a separate sheet, which only depends upon the well plan. And we've not defined any key code, like the combination between the, so the idea is that from the well plan, LZ, WI, 2B, and slot recovery, the combination, we need to show that how the combination is creating a key, a unique bomb reference.

 And then based upon the same reference, the bomb would be created. That message is not getting cleared here in the in the sheet when you've prepared.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
But I think we will have to take some additional parameter, right?

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
That's something we'll discuss if if required, right? We are. See the idea is what we have here presenting that.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah, this one for example. Lower zakum, slot recovery, completion code 2B for WI well type. We have two different rows. This is not a unique key code.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1:
Unless you look at the well number.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, so ultimately we're planning for well. So we say that well number is ZK108 and for that ZK108 the combination of the four parameters LZ, to be in slot recovery.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yes, so you want to split this into two sheets. Yes, based on the value, OK?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We need to switch to the call. Yeah, let's jump.

Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2:
Khushboo, can you share the sheet with me so that if required I can pull up and share this in the chat?

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah, I'll send it to you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thanks. Okay, thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Bye.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Bye!
