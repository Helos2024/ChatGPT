So as soon as they call me, I will join to that meeting because I think it's more important. Yeah, sure. Let's continue on this one. Let me share the screen because I was preparing a document. Yeah. OK. So the idea, Tim, is we were discussing with Basti and the idea is to start having these technical sessions. I think that we need to have a strong alignment between any track, in this case, Yusawul, for MRO, typical cement planning, and Sagar, that is taking the integration part.\n\n So the idea, so Sebastian, I don't know if we have communicated to Sagar that we want to take more responsibility."},{"start_time":1734350631842,"end_time":1734350700118,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, I had a one-to-one later, but we can say it right away.

But your role is going to be more into, of course, plan the activities, define the activities from the integration point of view, and also executing some of these activities.\n\n When you cannot, because of availability or because you need some other technical expertise, we will delegate, you delegate to a different team that we are currently sourcing, okay?"},{"start_time":1734350700118,"end_time":1734350701729,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Looking to source."},{"start_time":1734350701729,"end_time":1734350716031,"speaker":{"name":"Sagar Vora"},"words":"Okay, okay.

Okay. Yeah, it means joining calls is not a problem. Okay, I can join calls and I can gather the information. Only like I have attended some of the drilling calls, so I have some but for MRO and chemical I have never means not attended any single session. So for that I mean, yeah, like I need some more information so that I am more comfortable.\n\n But yeah, that's fine.

That's why we will have these sessions on a the points that we need to progress. As you are having questions, as you are needing, we are going to be there. On the first session that we have with the customer, with the client, we also will be there providing all the context studies required. Let me share the screen. I've been preparing this based on the document that Reynaldo has currently.\n\n The idea is that we have this. Let me hide this. Not important. We will have this main tab in which we will check all, everything. Of course, I'm open to suggestion. This is just our first approach that I have to this. You have the status for each track, MRO, chemicals, drilling, and the site quest that we have here on the chain. And here, if we need to go to any detail of each mass data we have here, you can go here and to see the fields that we have so far.\n\n So this is like a very normal status in this case because we are just defining if this is confirmed and so on. Then we can explore more statuses as soon as we start developing this. But so far it's just a matter if we need to confirm or not that we are going to use it or not. So I put some little I was deleting a lot of things that I think that we are not going to use. The ones that are in red is because it's very likely that we are not using it in full.\n\n Then the customer ones, there are a lot to confirm there. We haven't specifically talked about that. Luggage material, that is one of the big ones. I clean it. And I also added all the things that the IML team was suggesting. So we have here a lot of But this was part of the first technical session that we have with AdNoc team. This is only from IT side. So I think that also we need to validate with the functional team if they are going to use anything of this or not.\n\n I guess that many of these fields maybe are not really relevant, right? But I did the first approach and clean up all the things that I think that are important and what is not. Important and so on. So what is on red is, as I say, that is still not making sense. And let's go back. So here, basically, I'm putting what we need to iterate, mass data or general, for demand, sorry, for demand in general, or supply and IOU, that usually they share a lot of the mass data, then the key fields that we have on demand, and key fields that we have on supply, basically supply, because on IO, I haven't seen any, at least this key field doesn't apply for inventor optimization.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734350970428,"end_time":1734350971820,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"They are poorly supplied."},{"start_time":1734350971820,"end_time":1734351039222,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"If we need some key fields for inventor optimization, we can put it there.

This is inside of this one. Here we have, save this doc, and do it here. It's a comment. So I'm putting the different status that we have.\n\n As you know, I put in progress this one, because we started discussing, in one moment of time we stopped discussing about this, but we already have something. It's not that we are going to start from scratch, so we need to take again these sessions and start discussing again about these fears in order to close it.

Usually, they maintain the PM module on S4HANA. In which they keep the maintenance activities. And what are the frequency of these activities, the preventive maintenance activities? What are the bill of materials associated to these activities? But we are finding that in Agno they are not using it properly. So they don't have the information as we need it.\n\n We are not completely sure that we are going to use this field at all so far. So that's something that I have like kind of an alert. It should be a reality because it's something that we need to still validate on the same sessions if we are going to have them or not. So far, it seems that instead of having the activity per se, they have the materials directly that they are going to use. They have work orders, not planned activities.\n\n So, yes, I think that we need to validate more on that regard. It's one of the activities that I think that we need to finish BASTI in one moment. It's an important definition, and of course, it's affecting the region. The only thing – BASTI – and not to deep dive on this, but the only thing that we can get from the activities is maybe if you want to create the forecast of the activities maybe on the activities intrinsically you have the frequency and it's much easier to replicate a forecast instead of trying to replicate by material and by activity I'm thinking something related like the work order you know work order type or job type yeah that's the"},{"start_time":1734351231203,"end_time":1734351270385,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"only one I mean then what what business business show to us is basically he has the order number and Order type but order type is fine.
