I told him the risks and the delay of one month we have. We never had the chance to brief Khalid about the training thing, but I told him to tell them exactly what we mentioned. The trainer is here to stay, plus also us. Shadowing, working with them to train the end-users. What we also need as an action item with them is telling them, look, we need to sit down with you and do the proper count.\n\n While we as a process team, we know this role X, role Y, but we need to tell them, okay, for this role or this end-user or key user or process owner, we need to get a count so that we plan.

Let's call them discussion topics slash issues slash risks because right now it's either based on memory or me hijacking the whole call, not letting anyone talk etc. But it should be more based on the hot topics and depending on their impact on overall plan timeline rather than If I'm just like, The loudest to talk, then that's it.\n\n Maybe we don't have this list now, but at least we will build it. At least from my side. The one or two weeks that are burning are. Related to this drilling data and drilling industry understanding because it's it's getting a bit. Let's say tricky. And the other is the approval on Dockets overall. BP. Maybe I'll start with briefing you. The Steer Co went relatively well. We briefed them on almost a month plus or minus of delay.\n\n They definitely there was a sort of question, but not like a panic. They tried, they asked if we can reduce this etc. We told them at this point we've consumed all the working in parallel. We'll definitely continue to do our best, however. Now we have to collectively bite the bullet because also we cannot just keep delaying some critical path items. Which also is good for them and for us. Them so that they know sometimes when their internal process is slow, we cannot do magic.\n\n For us is to start learning from those and identifying if we have similar over the next few months, maybe from now we need to raise them and tell Khaled, Firas, et cetera. Look, based on experience, we have two or three similar cases where instead of a week, it might take three. What do you want us to do so we don't end up with a multiple change request and delay? The other part where they discussed they wanted this famous drilling release alternative, I think given that earliest it can go is April 30, plus some prerequisite for it.\n\n They said it will not make sense if it's that late, so we dropped it and we're back to our original plan. Their only request, but I think Hadi and Sebastian can work on it, is in our original plan, which is wave one, wave two, if we merge them, we don't do two go lives, and we save on this ad-hoc release and the regression testing those things that are penalty per release. Would there be savings and how much?\n\n We told them, look, we'll check. We do not want to share any promises. There might be savings, but it might not be that much. We can do this more from a PM perspective. Sebastian, Hadi, myself, but you just need to be aware of it. Hopefully this way we don't get distracted anymore by those alternative plans and we focus at the risks. On the risk side. So this is a quick brief. That's a good news. That's a good news that we are not working on alternate plans anymore.\n\n Because anyway, it's becoming too late to switch to that plan. We're almost like in flight. You're halfway through the destination and you're changing the route. But yeah, I mean, this is the quick update. On top of the two risks I mentioned, so let's try to be more disciplined and add risks impacting us, because the drilling data will definitely hurt us if we do not figure out what they have, address their concern about our drilling understanding, and try to get the data we need for BOM, blah, blah, that's important, and approval of processes.\n\n Around the table quickly, let's add to this list if we have, then we'll talk about each of them, this way we know the full picture. I'll let the rest of the team risks."},{"start_time":1734617352771,"end_time":1734617360585,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"So just to confirm, the alternative plan was confirmed, was it not confirmed? No, because it's April 30."},{"start_time":1734617360585,"end_time":1734617378817,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"For them, they thought it could be March or Feb, let alone those prerequisites. I mean, even before talking about the prerequisite, they said it's April 30, no, let's go back to the original plan. Okay, so we keep the same plan?"},{"start_time":1734617378817,"end_time":1734617379685,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yeah, yeah."},{"start_time":1734617379685,"end_time":1734617437660,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Now, definitely When we talked about original plan, there was the previous option, those three releases. We went back and forth on a couple of how if we do this or that, but we tried and Firas helped to push for the original one just to minimize any more calculations, exercise, futile discussions, which is good. However, just because there is always something, they said, okay, we'll go back to original Just see if actually Firas suggested it.\n\n If we make them one release, will you benefit and how much? Which is doable. It's not the end of the world. So let's now focus on our original plan activities and address all our mitigating risk we have and proceed. What risks team you'd like to add to the two I mentioned and then We can talk about each of them briefly."},{"start_time":1734617437660,"end_time":1734617467263,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"So one thing what we can do is that a suggestion from my side that me and Khusu have a list of actions, which we say we have the entire list. Many of those are technical in nature, what we are discussing with the team. And it also has some of the items which can qualify to be the risk for the project, and then which can be qualified to the list of what Adi is mentioning."},{"start_time":1734617467263,"end_time":1734617544224,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"So probably what I would recommend is that you need to elevate or talk at the higher level. For example, we're talking drilling data, which is a topic you highlighted before, but also we're now facing as we're trying to get from them their extract and so this is the, it might, it shouldn't be detail of that item, but it's a big ticket, let's call it, because we need also to be careful about the level of details.\n\n This is more of a risk identification in this case, and then we discuss the solution separately. Similar to BPD and BRD for Wave 1, the approvals we're trying to chase, SDD, and also Wave 2 document, that's another risk we'll discuss now. So if you'd like to share topic of granular not activity definitely but keep those in mind as an example if you got my point I got your point so right now I don't have anything top of my mind we have the list so I will get back to Hadi if there is anything which we have a plan to have a chat with you let's let's do something tomorrow yes Anup Kishore has a list already so let's meet up"},{"start_time":1734617544224,"end_time":1734617555594,"speaker":{"name":"Roumanos, Hadi"},"words":"tomorrow you me and kushboo so that we update that excel and then we can migrate it to tara on monday so that she can use it as a reference point for all others ongoing right so but at least let's"},{"start_time":1734617555594,"end_time":1734617566682,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"make sure it's in decent condition in the morning yeah yeah so I think kushboo and me we've reviewed it so that's uh there are a lot of things which we can review but yeah let's have that discussion separately spend"},{"start_time":1734617566682,"end_time":1734617578196,"speaker":{"name":"Roumanos, Hadi"},"words":"time around that list and qualify the items which uh together we feel I want to that's fine that's fine I want to add to which I'll talk about once we're done with this topic, but I'll let you guys finish"},{"start_time":1734617578196,"end_time":1734617579949,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"first.

When they need something, yesterday, then this is not a fair relationship. Let's park this, because I want us to add to the list anything that is actually keeping us stressed out and causing delays, like the approval, like the missing data or unclear data. I can add, let's say, the quantification of end users that we'll need, because this might bite us later in terms of how many training sessions we need, so on and so forth.\n\n We can add it to the list, but I don't think now during this call we'll have the time. So that's an example of what items to add as a risk. Rest of the team, any burning thing, let me use this. Let me help you filter whatever you want to share.

The reason why I say that is because we have a number of things which need to incorporate those answers into them. One of them being the CM approach or strategy deck, which was a deliverable that we submitted quite a while ago, but Alia and Emma have come back and they've asked us to incorporate AR commentary into that deliverable now as well.\n\n We're going to align that with the answers from those FAQs.

So you don't need to be nasty with her, leave this to me, but you can tell her we're waiting for approval of the design document, which she should be aware of from her, I think, manager, Asma, and then the rest we can discuss with Asma and Khaled.\n\n Okay, nice, thanks. Yeah, again, we already have almost incurred a month plus or minus of delay for the project, which means some of our deadlines will have to shift. We can have a separate discussion on this.

We spent 15 minutes just agreeing on the topics. So let's... Let's be more organized or help us be more organized with data. But now that I think we have a list, let's start maybe with the drilling data, because I know between GoSCM and KPMG team will need to agree on a plan. But actually let's do this, a quick 30 seconds per for SDD and for the design documents approval, where we start.\n\n I know about SDD, parties, integration, architecture, not architecture, cyber security to get it approved.

I think this needs some attention. I left because on the call I heard Dustin and Raul and I had to leave the phone with. Sustain. After Latif. Now.\n\n My humble suggestion on the group chat is let's check their extract. Today they went through explaining a bit more that September cheat. And they said, look, this is what we mean by that. This is what we mean by this field, et cetera. I asked Kinan if he can help us, and this is on your team, if you think it's a good idea. I think at least it doesn't hurt. If he will go through this Excel with us.\n\n Called GTCS or whatever acronym that he can help us with. I know you can look them up, but he can explain how is it into the context of drilling or what does it mean. That's from understanding now from extracting the data. I knew we have some opinions that said. Let's give them the Excel sheet and they should fill it. Let's be realistic. It will not happen. We can even keep waiting. Which were already delayed further because the proper integration is not working.\n\n Or we need to work with them like Abdul Latif suggested. We start and then we work with them in iterations. Anyone has an objection on this approach or think that we need to change the course before we agree on how soon we can do this? I'll let Raul and Bastian, because I think you're the main stakeholders here."},{"start_time":1734618154316,"end_time":1734618158594,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"I will wait for Ashin to answer."},{"start_time":1734618158594,"end_time":1734618276724,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"So regarding the data, we are aligned with Arun to start loading what we have based on the understanding of today's meeting. But we will do this after we finish the documentation, this is our priority. I mean, we understand both are urgent, but we're going to finish the documentation and hopefully tomorrow we will start loading the data first on the template we created and then into the system. And based on that, the idea is to first, of course, review the demo with Rahul to make sure we are fulfilling the requirement and at least we have some understanding of the requirements and that we are fulfilling them.\n\n As they expect and then once we are in line with that we can jump into a demo session with them to confirm that initial requirements are being fulfilled and then get more data because as I said in the data meeting we are not covering a lot of parts of the solution and mostly additional well it doesn't work to go into the details but let's say we're covering I will say three quarters of the initial demand setting.\n\n We're not covering anything relating to supply. And we are still missing some part of the demand side. So there's plenty much to cover. And this is just for onshore, if I'm not mistaken. Offshore, they have a completely different information setting, a template. Not in our solution. In their solution, they have a completely different They share it a little bit today, but we didn't get the same level of understanding that we get for onshore.\n\n So of course we cannot do our analysis based on onshore, which again I said is the side where we have more understanding."},{"start_time":1734618276724,"end_time":1734618286669,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Let me comment on this.

Yeah, as you said, if we finish the documentation, send it to them for feedback and approval, we can switch to something else. So we're online now. I understand that not all the data will be available, I think. Absorbing their reaction, their frustration, their misunderstanding. I don't know what to call it. And trying to get the Max out of that Arun was sharing, which I think is what they sent in September, will help us just reduce this sort of tension between us and them.\n\n I think in this case, Bastian and Arun, that you still need some clarification where Kinan going through this list will tell you, look, this is what's meant by this one, or this is why it's added. I'll give you an example. Until we understood the concept of completion code or whatever is related to the drill being planned or the well being, there is a well that is now going to be operational. Probably we could have misunderstood the concept, the word of completion, something different.\n\n If you need any help, and I think Kinan is ready, Mo is also supportive on this, we discussed it with him, in going through that Excel and getting some clarification or you're okay?"},{"start_time":1734618371666,"end_time":1734618438759,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"No we are okay for for at least for the initial initial understanding but okay so they're they're requesting it's extraction so just one comment they are requesting for a drilling expert but I think the or misunderstanding or the initial need understanding we had it is not related to the drilling operation itself but it is to the way the they set the data, the way they structured the data. Even Vignesh, who is pretty knowledgeable in all data, he's not clear, he's not positive about the way they set the data.\n\n Again, it's something, the misunderstanding is technical. We have, of course, not expert. We have an initial understanding that this is not rocket science. We're planning the materials needed to build, to drill a well. No more than that. So the misunderstanding."},{"start_time":1734618438759,"end_time":1734618439149,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Correct."},{"start_time":1734618439149,"end_time":1734618584575,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"That's why I said it's a misunderstanding slash frustration. So in their mind, they shared this Excel sheet, which is not very organized or it's not easy to understand. When we ask them for data in a tabular form their easy interpretation and maybe again clients are clients sometimes they pick or get fixated on something and they keep just repeating maybe because in their data the way it's structured it's related to how the evolution or the value chain of training from the beginning the check or the whatever confirmation then the excavation blah blah on the they notice something and then now they're thinking okay not understanding the data because you don't have drilling.\n\n That's why I told the Latino. We have the experts, let's not just focus on it, we'll get that person, but also let's try to get the max out of the data. So you're right, it's not rocket science, but the only way to address this is to do this in baby steps, and then they'll feel, okay, we're fine, we can proceed. I think part of it is, if you remember that famous example of tie-in, and when we didn't know what's tie-in, they just made a big fuss about it.\n\n Also, keep in mind, even Dinesh is more proficient in chemicals and MRO, MRO mainly, not in drilling. Even Khaled told me we're more, I mean, them as the team, they're more aware of MRO, which is fine. There would be some things that they will help us with. I think what we're agreeing on, we will check. We will extract everything if there is a question about something. The only thing we need to be cautious about is not to ask them about something that is related to the business terminology, but more about the field itself or the value.\n\n And I'll give you an example before we close this.

Look, we need to manage the situation. Let's cut it short. We'll have to be smart, we'll use whatever Kinan can help us with, etc. Because again, if you're in their shoes, what does Adnook do?\n\n Drilling. Everything else is supporting of drilling. Maybe now they're a bit concerned, maybe they're overreacting, but for them we need someone who knows what a drilling company does, so they don't misunderstand anything and they plan or less than what we need. So this is me justifying or explaining their mindset. We'll have to figure it out. So let's address or try to understand everything, extract everything from that Excel.\n\n I think our best buffer is Vignesh. So if we're stuck with something, Arun and Bastian, as we do this, Vignesh is very supportive. And as you know, maybe you didn't see, he sits next to also Khaled and Firas.

This is part of our target design. I think if it's not mentioned in BPD or in SDP, I don't know where this fits. It's a reality. And believe me, they have so many solutions today that is not fully automated. As long as we document it properly and tell them how to do this, it's the nature of the beast. Because if I understood you properly, if it's data from S4, that will be done through integration.\n\n If it's data from DWS, it will be done through integration. If it's on Excel, they only have it on Excel, then they need to do the uploading. Is that the correct understanding, Hector and Arun? Exactly. And that means that they need to prepare and transform the data into format required. We can convince them, if that's possible, maybe I'm dreaming, that this data shouldn't be staying like this, floating.\n\n Maybe you need to find a home for it in DWS or S4. If it's a valid idea, maybe I'm wrong. That could be something that will tell them, look, This is becoming the weakest point in all of your system, because everything will be working like a well-oiled machine. If that Excel is not uploaded on time, then it's a mess. And I know Firas and Khaled will support by eliminating those exceptions, saying, guys, we're buying a system for millions of dollars between license and implementation.\n\n Why are we doing this? But before I jump to conclusion, we need to make sure we have an alternative recommendation. Saying guys, no, don't keep this on Excel.

And the last update was something different than we started conversation with, which means experiences that Abdul Latif is not having all the information and he's leading us to a path where one of the discomfort which is coming is also because of him not being able to understand their process completely.\n\n So I don't know if we have opportunity to give this feedback to Khalid because Khalid also understood this that if we discuss with Abdul Latif every time we are getting a different input which Vignesh also agreed to So I don't know if we can communicate this back to ADNOC and see if we can talk to someone else who is more long clear on the requirements."},{"start_time":1734619265877,"end_time":1734619329308,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Long story short, we can discuss this with Khaled and Vignesh.

Now, if none of them would know, then we need to highlight that we need someone. So the concept itself is valid. It's our right to request people who would have enough understanding.\n\n But to be honest, I'm not sure if this is a perception or you have specific examples. So if we want to open this topic with Khaled and not have clear examples, it might not help us or we might not go anywhere. Maybe we would like to start with the Excel that we have anyway, because this is fixed. It's known that this is what they use.
