He mentioned that it is more of a collaboration. We add a key figure, a drilling manager, and then the drilling manager will add their numbers, and then once they're okay with this, if let's say they're not okay with a specific number, they can change it and then run the job. But this is not really an approval. This is more like they're collaborating.\n\n This is like a draft mode of a forecast. What they want is like an approval chain that, hey, drilling manager approved it. Because if I'm the drilling manager, I'm not going to go ahead and look at all this Excel.

Kunal just now has shared with the team SAP has released a solution on flexible workflow based approval for IBP and what I understand from Sebastian is not part of a original scope or original IBP basic solution but it's an add-on which allows the workflow process to trigger changes in IBP which means that there are two solutions in terms of approval one the one huge bastion you were talking about which is key figure based approval where some if someone approves then the data can get copied from one keyboard figure to another and that's how the process triggers whereas the second one is more latest solution if go same team can have a look at that solution and prepare a demo or around the second solution, then we can go to AdNoc and propose that, OK, this is how traditionally IBP has been doing approvals.\n\n This is the latest feature which SAP has introduced for approvals. First one does not need license, but this is how it is executed. Second one needs license, but this is how it is executed. And let AdNoc decide which solution they would like to go. Now, based upon their decision, we can agree or disagree on what is the scope change it brings into the solution.

There is an app called process management that I think is very similar to what IBP is proposing here. And I said to the guys in the morning so the only difference is that you will have like an additional tab in the Excel in which it will say it will list all your tasks for example for a manager let's say for a drilling planner manager it will say review a review forecast okay if you click okay it's done a hundred percent it will it will trigger a job, it will trigger the execution of a job, okay?\n\n Which, of course, you need to build the process so that happens, but it's no more than that. So I think the only thing we're replacing is that instead of the manager clicking, okay, finish review, and selecting okay, we're replacing it, what we're proposing is replace that with the execution of a job based, of course, on the approval on that. This person reviewed the total number and said, OK, that number is OK.\n\n So I honestly don't see the value added of building that in comparison with what we already have or what we Agree, the only thing I want to- If we are able to present a compelling alternative to what we're proposing, I don't have any problem to go with that.

Well, we had a different meeting to address the data issues, but where we discussed I don't know if Mo, you can go back to demand drilling. So we have two options. The first option was to like the multi-level collaboration, which is basically, let's say drilling planner put 100, then this number gets automatically translated into a new key figure, which is let's call it drilling manager input.\n\n And he can change it or not change it. And then this number gets automatically after, I don't know, a certain date, can translate it into a final forecast, okay? So if the, or maybe, or instead of automatically, that once, is the drill manager responsible to run the job that will take that input and put it in the final forecast, okay? The second alternative is you just have one input. And they have a certain part of the process.\n\n Of course, the first one to collaborate is always the drilling planner. And once he finalized the input, he can send an email, send a message to the drilling manager and say, oh, please take a look at the numbers. And he can reply, OK, change this, change that, increase this, decrease And once that process is finished, then the approval is symbolized by the execution, by the run of a job, which is the copy operator from this input into the final forecast.\n\n Okay. So we have these two options. One is more sequential and the second one is more like an open dialogue between the members of the team. These are the two alternatives, but both have the approval part, which is symbolized by the run of a job that takes the forecast and put it in the final forecast, which is like the agreed number. So those are my two alternatives. We can discuss now which guys you think is the best based on the discussion you had with them in the first few sessions.\n\n"},{"start_time":1730127554520,"end_time":1730127675220,"speaker":{"name":"Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"So both of them, I think, would become, I will not be happy with of the alternatives because they are expecting probably a notification-based approval, which means that someone gets notified, someone looks at the request, approves it, and then it makes the changes. Now, for sure, the only way to confirm it is to present to AdNoc so that they understand how the IPP works and they understand how the approval in IBP is expected, and their expectations can be aligned.\n\n Now, the only thing what I, and since you guys have been technical expert, you'll have to, I will agree to your evaluation and say that this is the only possible solution. But then the only worry I have is, we clearly know that AdNoc is not expecting that. So if AdNoc is not expecting that, and if we go ahead with solution the discussion it will lead to more discussion and all the approval process will fall out of the design phase and or it can delay the overall requirement gathering overall solution designing from a design phase so I just want to make sure that how soon how fast we can have this discussion with that now so that we clearly highlight them that this is how the solution will work and if there is a risk of all if there the gap and that gap creates discomfort but we need to make sure this gets discussed as soon as possible because what is happening is in the in the 2b workshops we are we are clearly saying that this can be discussed later this can be discussed later and but but when it comes to later uh it it will become a huge risk thing they will simply say that I don't want this solution and it may derail the entire 2b process uh approval thing because they would say that we don't agree with the 2b process because the approval is in line with what we expect.\n\n"},{"start_time":1730127675220,"end_time":1730127747985,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, so OK, just just following that line of thought. I think I will mean I don't and I will take a look at the at the app that you're proposing and we will see if it follows what you're what you're the requirement that you're mentioning. So basically there's like a notification and based on that notification. The manager can. Can act, right? But yeah, question. So let's say, okay, the demand planners define a number 100.\n\n Okay. Then he click, okay, finish, finish collaboration, whatever it is. Okay. Then the manager gets, gets an email or, or somehow a notification. And he says, he thinks, no, this is, this is, uh, uh, to, uh, this is greater, this is above what I expected or this is below what I expected, I expect. What should be the next step? Should he change it by himself or he should give like some feedback to the other guy?\n\n So let's do one thing."},{"start_time":1730127747985,"end_time":1730127808694,"speaker":{"name":"Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Let's do this other way around. For sure you know how it happens today. If you can have a look at what input Kunal is providing and then if you know how the solution works then probably give it it gives us more data and insight on how we can propose if AdNoc says that okay if manager is supposed to contribute or manager is supposed to only confirm if manager is supposed to contribute then we know which solution works better and if manager is supposed agree or disagree upon, then we know which solution works better.\n\n At this point of time, we can ask this question. Tomorrow we have a meeting with the ad hoc, and we can ask such clarifying questions on how they want the approvals to be, so that while we are evaluating possible solution options, we can consider this as one of the inputs."},{"start_time":1730127808694,"end_time":1730127829698,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Will that work, Bastian?

But we've tried to put this point across, and you were also part of the discussion, but AdNoc is simplifying no to collaboration. They would like to reduce meetings.\n\n They would like the user interaction. They would like more things to be automated and in offline mode, which means that we will have to look at the approval functionality. And then probably not looking at traditional way how IBP is worked upon but then make it specific we'll have to look at the solutions and propose what best would we work and that in that case probably we can we can demonstrate two different solution options where one based upon workflow people simply complete their task and things move ahead which means no one is talking to each other on a meeting basis and only a new to need to talk business which means only if they have concerns they will talk to people and get those concerns identified or else it will simply move in one direction or how a collaboration can happen we can probably show them a probably something around collaboration but we already know they don't want collaboration so that's the concern I even I am having but the other issues we don't have a lot of time we've had we need to by next 15th of like by 15th we need to make sure that the documentations are approved or at least to be processed for inventory and demand have to be closed in next two weeks now one of the important part of this to be process is collaboration and workload and approval so we need to make sure that that this week we at least have some discussion around it, share them something if possible, and at the earliest possible so that we can pin down this one specific requirement, and at least try to close things around.\n\n I am not sure how good we'll be to close this. But if we don't even show something to them, then we'll not be able to for sure close it. So that's the concern I'm having. And I'm in alignment with you. We are not in really good shape when it comes to approval. But then it is the fact and we know our timeline.

He, of course, is not going to review every single material he reviewed. Just let's say each planner is in charge of one category. One plan, whatever it is, okay? And within that plan or within that category, you can have thousands of products.\n\n Of course, the manager won't have the time to review every single combination. So the planners do their job, their review, let's say 1,000 combinations, and then they have this meeting, or it could be maybe not even a meeting. They just notify, look, This is, I finished the collaboration, and then at a higher level, the manager reviewed the number and compared it with something. It could be compared with the budget, or it could be a comparison with what was the forecast for the previous year, or the variations, what changed, what was the, I don't know, the largest variation.\n\n More than 25%, it works to have, take a look at that. And then based on that, he gives an input, no, decrease or increase by 10%. Okay, and then the planners finds a way to make that adjustment because it cannot be just like, okay, decrease everything 10%."},{"start_time":1730128080746,"end_time":1730128116288,"speaker":{"name":"Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"And that's it.

That is either weekly bucket or monthly bucket, whatever we have finalized.\n\n So we have a supply plan based on that or a particular bucket now we are running the what if scenario analysis that is also in the time series but at the last stage we are creating a purchase equation and stock transfer equation so where we are going the transfer from time series data to order so that part I think we missed out if you scroll up more I think it's now right scroll up and just give you a new final supply plan this is still we are in time series only and directly we are creating a PR so between this to this final supply plan first we need to transfer into order based planning then we can again we need to do the supply planning right So that part is missing actually.\n\n Sorry, I didn't know what I understood. No, see, you have done the what if scenario analysis. In that what we have done, we have either increased the quantity of our supply plan or something based on the inventory parameter. Then we have reviewed the supply plan. So reviewing of supply plan, still it is in bucket based planning, weekly bucket or monthly bucket.

I understand we are trying to use a functionality which is more relevant for MRO. Based on what SAP is provided.

Once the design is finalized and once probably we have more clarity that we may not use any of those features. Considering the supply stations are concluded, that's the case. Then probably I'd not can save some money on not utilizing this license on renegotiate with SAP for a better something.\n\n But then we just want to be sure that we I'd not does not need any of features or their understanding of why they procured this license needs to be clarified. And it's not that I just because Adnok has procured, which means we have to use that license, but it should be more whether they need it or not. And if they need it, we'll utilize it. If they don't need it, then we should provide this feedback to Adnok as well, eventually.\n\n Not immediately, but after we have done all analysis, we understand completely all the requirements.
