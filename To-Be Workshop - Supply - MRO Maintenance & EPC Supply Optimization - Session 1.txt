We're also going to, because we are showing you the leading practice for supply planning, so we're going to assess the degree of fit as well as also assess and then cover what is a gap from a business requirement or if it is a technical gap.\n\n And then lastly is that because we are introducing a new tool, so we also need to understand that there will be some process changes within ADNOC and then in order to leverage the leading solution. So where we are in the design field. So right now we are holding those design workshops We are at the very last stage of supply of the design, which is the supply planning. We've conducted the assess, so we've done as is assessment as well as we've been preparing for the system demo.\n\n What is coming is the gap closure, so whatever gap that we've been gathering is that we're Um, close those gap, uh, propose solutions or either from a process perspective or from a technical point of view.

So, the first one is to have a consolidated procurement process, okay, that will use as many inputs. First of all, statistical forecast generated through multiple machine learning algorithms and also an optimized inventory policy that as we reviewed during the inventory sessions includes pattern recognition and then the use of the appropriate model.\n\n The models that we are IVD has and we are using are mainly three. The first one is the normal distribution. The second one is the alpha distribution. And finally, specifically for MRO part is Poisson distribution, which models the consumption of spare parts with very low frequency of consumptions. Then the second benefit is that the system gives long-term and high-level visibility, allowing better tactical decisions to be made.\n\n An example for these tactical decisions are, for example, budgeting. If we know how much we will buy for the next five years, we can make better budgeting decisions. And also, another example can be de-stocking. If we are not consuming, and the system will give us that disability, If we are not consuming maybe an irrelevant part that is not critical, maybe we can proceed to dispose the material if it's not needed anymore.\n\n Another benefit can be the visualization of the value stock across the different locations. The next one will be proactive planning, considering open orders, reservation, and lead time. That we will cover during this session. How the planning will address not only, of course, the demand and inventory policy, but also the open purchase orders, the reservation, and the lead times through the different locations.\n\n This is going to be a key point with the presentation, which is the next one, the forecast consumption for reservation modeling. What's the purpose of using this is to avoid double counting, and in short, purchasing the right amount, okay? So, of course, we will review this in full detail in the system, but from a conceptual point of view, the forecast consumption is basically a way to transform, it's true, encompass my plan with reality.\n\n Reality being a reservation and plan being forced."},{"start_time":1731564983777,"end_time":1731564984348,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1731564984348,"end_time":1731565262581,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Another benefit of using IVPs, increase the material availability while minimizing expedited shipping costs by downtime. Sorry. Increase the material availability while minimizing expedited shipping costs and downtime caused by delays. If we have a better plan, a more solid plan, of course, we don't have to incur into to expeditize orders, right? And that will reduce our costs. So this is one of the benefits and one of the goals of using IVP.\n\n Another one is to, we will be able to balance the stock across multiple locations, okay? As said, the movement, the possible movements in the system are, of course, first from vendors, two ad-hoc locations, but also between ad-hoc locations. In case there is a demand that needs to be fulfilled, and there's another location that has an overstock, the system will generate this moving automatically. Then we have capacity to evaluate multiple what-if instances.\n\n Areas. I think this is a very useful feature of the system where we can see what is the impact on our current platform. For example, changing a lead time, changing a service level, what if I'm able to expedite an order, so on and so forth. These examples that I'm giving for scenarios are possible to be modeled in the system in a very quick way and generating very quick results. If a planner faces in a situation of uncertainty and he needs to assess different scenarios, he can do that in the system in a very quick and straightforward way.\n\n Finally, alert to planning by exceptions. We're going to cover also this during the demo. Of course, AdNoc has a massive amount of data, a massive amount of products being such a large company. Of course, we understand and SAP understand that it's not possible to plan everything manually. The users need that the system guide them to identify where they can add more value, and this is done through alerts.\n\n The system will tell you, focus this, focus that, this doesn't look right. Analyze it and see how it can be solved. A point that I want to highlight here about the others, that of course, the system comes with plenty of standardized standards. We also, with the best practices, we're going to recommend more alert. But during the process of you interacting with the system, you'll be hands-on testing your data.\n\n You will find the need of creating new alerts, and the system is very flexible in that regard. So we can start working in configuring them, testing them, and see if they really add value to your analysis. So following the same your input here when we start the testing phase is crucial. And this is not just for others, but in general, in KPIs, in terms of data, in terms of all the technical part, and not just technical, but also from the most business process, is that we need, and this is our strategy, we need you to get hands-on on the system as soon as possible so you can start giving feedback regarding the functionalities.\n\n We don't want you to give feedback based on just a vision or an idea of what the system is. We want you to give us feedback based on interact with system testing using your real data, and based on that, we receive feedback and we prioritize them and and starting to configure."},{"start_time":1731565262581,"end_time":1731565263032,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"OK."},{"start_time":1731565263032,"end_time":1731565266195,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Is there any doubt at this point?"},{"start_time":1731565266195,"end_time":1731565282010,"speaker":{"name":"Prathviraj Anchan (Borouge)"},"words":"Yeah, in that fourth benefit, which you are mentioning here, forecast consumption for reservation modeling to avoid double counting.

The forecast is something that. I'm planning to to use, right? So when when then? Buying or purchasing or distributing, you need to balance these two things.\n\n You need to deduct the reservations to the forecast. So, you are not counting the demand source two times.

One is going to be the forecast, what we are proposing, but then you also have what is happening right now, that is the actor. So for the current month, you are saying we are going to use three pieces, but you know that you already are using one and you are reserving another one. So you want to have that into consideration to know double counting. You don't want to use the forecast and at the same time use the actor to trigger the demand because you know that the forecast is encompassing the accuracy that you are having on the current month.\n\n So that is what we are trying to avoid. You have just one demand input considering the reality and forecast instead of having the double counting that we are discussing.

Which means that system knows how this metal has been consumed for the next past three to five years. Based upon that, the forecast proposes that how much quantity you should buy and when you should buy. Now, if there is any consumption requirement, up to the forecast should not create a duplical requirement, which means if you have forecast of 10 and up to 10, you are covered for any requirement which is coming now if the consumption is changing based upon what the forecast was or the was the metal was system will trigger this additional uh procurement plan based upon changing consumption so that it's every month it is looking for what has been consumed and every month it is updating the forecast to make sure you is in line with what has been consumed day in day out, which means that if there is an unplanned requirement, it's essentially not unplanned because you're planning through forecast.\n\n And then if this requirement is more than what you have in forecast, then only system will trigger additional procurement because the forecast was not planning this much deviation with respect to the actual consumption. So there are two scenarios. Unplanned consumption is more than forecast, which means we need. We need to increase the forecast and buy more if the unplanned requirement is less than forecast, which means forecast is already considering it, which means we don't need to buy it.\n\n"},{"start_time":1731565753586,"end_time":1731565779449,"speaker":{"name":"Aboobacker M.

So we understand you already have a scenario where the metal reservations trigger procurement stock lies in inventory but there is no consumption we are not using that data to generate forecast we are using actual consumption data to drive forecast which means the the opportunity of consumption would be predicted based upon actual consumption only from the goods issue what which has been done because it has been done which has been done like for how much time means how much you will take check for three years five years Ideally, three to five years period is considered or identified as sufficient for forecasting.\n\n But in your case, we can have the discussion of how much period we need to consider, considering you may not have a lot of consumption probably in first three years, and five years or more than five years.

Now the question here is, or the more complexity which comes is, if there is no agreement, what happens?\n\n If there is no agreement from the PR which is approved, the guidelines which are given by the procurement is 10 weeks for any non-shareholder cases to issue an order. We can only rely on KPIs which are set by the procurement team.

Now when the forecast is just a demand.\n\n Now on top of it, IBP will also look at inventory available at different locations, different plants, different warehouses, different storage locations based upon MRP areas, and then consider what is the final procurement proposal. So today, your procurement proposal is just looking at inventory in a specific plant. Checking with the inventory goes below the reorder point. And based upon the lead time and the MOQ parameters you have set up, you trigger the purchase requisition.\n\n Whereas in case of IPP, it will not look at only the reorder point, but it will use this historical consumption to forecast as I have explained.

I guess that you have many slow movers, mid movers and so on in which you are okay because the failure frequency is so low that you can just base all what you're doing on the reorder point as you're doing it, maintaining the stock levels that you already know and so on.\n\n But if we move, what's the value? I don't know. If we move to the fast movers with a higher frequency, you can find scenarios in which it's better to anticipate the future needs. Many of the cases, for example, you will have preventive plans in which you, in the future, you will have a peak on the demand because of that. Maybe in some cases you have some seasonality, right?

In this case, we're recalculating the inventory parameters, reorder point, base form, history, and advanced algorithms for inventory optimization.\n\n So we are already making a change. And then, of course, some of the benefits that I highlighted here, you have a long-term feasibility. Although you are triggering the purchase based on a consumption on your stock being lower than the reorder point, you still have the visibility or how much you will need over the course of the next five years.

So these are going to be system proposals.

So I don't see a distinct advantage. Then if I'm talking about the fast movers, which might be about another 10 to 15%, I need to really see what is a distinct advantage that this supply proposal is going to give me vis-a-vis the current order quantity that I'm putting or the PR quantity that I'm generating to confirm that yes, it's making a benefit.\n\n I hope I made my point clear."},{"start_time":1731567138599,"end_time":1731567223290,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"While you are assuming some things and probably may not be able to realize benefit on theoretical discussions what we are having, we completely understand you need to look at your data to make sure the benefits are understood clearly.

Again, The planning horizon is from three to five years in the future. As we said in the beginning, the first step in demand planning is to generate an agreed material forecast at material and location level that will be updated on a monthly basis. These agreed material forecasts come from in MRO from two sources, corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance.\n\n With that, we will be able, and of course, master data, we will be able to generate the inventory policies, meaning safety stock and reorder point at material location level and on a monthly basis again. With these two components, agreed forecast and inventory policies, we can generate our supply plan or procurement plan, which will be translated into PRs and plan, as we were discussing, which be translated into SDRs, okay?\n\n And the focus level here is, of course, material, the vendor. For example, we can have multiple vendors and maybe all the requirements needs to be divided based on a quote arrangement that can be addressed in the system. And then, also, for the SDRs, the level is or origin location, and chip two, which is destination location.

This, of course, this financial view is not as frequent as the other parts of the process.\n\n During the demo, we're going to focus here on the planning in the planning step, in the planning process. But as we saw during prior sessions, we have corrective maintenance, we have preventive maintenance, which are going to be combined. Well, corrective is generated through a forecast, preventive is being integrated from Rojana, And then with that, we will generate, as I said, the inventory policy.\n\n And then with all these combines, we jump into the supply plan where we will run a supply operator that will generate the supply proposals. And once we approve these proposals, we can integrate it into S4HANA."},{"start_time":1731568686267,"end_time":1731568956446,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"I would like to stop here a little bit because maybe some of you were not on the prior sessions. As Mo was saying at the beginning, we have been conducting several sessions where we were focusing on demand planning, inventory planning, and supply planning. Each stage is going to be connected, and it's going to have different inputs, and of course, it's going to generate different outputs. One key different approach here, because I know that you are so used to work on order based planning is that here you have the forecast.\n\n Now, for some cases that we were discussing at the beginning, a forecast is going to be the trigger for the PRs and all of that. So, that's why you have a demand planning part in which you have for MRO two different sources of demand. One of them is the preventive. It's what you already know. These are your plan These are going to be future needs of materials, so we need to take this into consideration and plan with anticipation and accordingly to those needs.\n\n And we need to generate PRs and so on. But then there is another part that is the corrective. That is what is uncertain. We are not planning and inspecting, of course. And here is where IDP is going to provide a statistical forecast to try to forecast that need on the future. So we account for what we are planning and for what we are not planning. Those are my two sources of demand, okay? Whatever statistical forecast or what we generate on the system is going to be a proposal that always the planner can assess and say, this makes sense.\n\n I leave it. This doesn't make sense. I overwrite. I adjust, okay? Of course, we understand that it happens. Too many combinations. The idea is that here we review exception-based, we review the critical ones, the rest probably we can leave it to the system. Whenever we have the forecast right now, we can go to inventory optimization. So what I'm going to propose here and the value added is that in many cases it's going to automate the inventory policies.\n\n It's going to to calculate for you the safety stock, the reorder point, the maximum inventory. All of that is going to be calculated by the system. I know that in many cases, as we were discussing, there is not a lot of room for improvement because we already have the minimum stock levels for very infrequent failures. But for your cases, it can optimize and can tell you how much you should have as a minimum safety as a buffer for uncertainty, what should be your reorder point based on that, and what should be your maximum level.\n\n And when we get to supply planning, what we saw on the prior stages, the demand forecast, the inventory policies are going to be an important input for us. So we are going to base our PR generations, our stock transfers based on these needs. That we need to fulfill, but we also need to consider the supply chain constraints. So, we are going to take the reality of ADNO, we are going to put it in a model, we are going to consider lead times, load sizes, constraints, capacity constraints, materials constraints.\n\n If you have always everything that is ongoing right now, like the open fuels, the reservations, all of that needs to be taken into consideration. When we generate this. So as you will see, there are many, many inputs. Today in the demo, we will try to show you some flavor of what can be the many inputs. In the future, you will be finding that there are many more options. As soon as we see a need, probably we will give you a solution and we'll tell you, yes, we can cover this by using this feature of the system.\n\n All right, so I just wanted to highlight because we have have three different stages here that is very important. Maybe some of you were not on the previous sessions, but prior to supply planning, we are generating some inputs from the system that today you don't have, at least automated, and we are going to automate it here on the"},{"start_time":1731568956446,"end_time":1731569126493,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 4"},"words":"system and use it for the PR generation and STR generation. Before we jump into the walk you through the process. So as Hector has mentioned, in the supply planning, the inputs that we're gathering is the demand planning for MRO, as well as the inventory planning, because we need the inventory parameters. What the system now will do is will identify what is the planning time, right? Are we talking about advanced planning time, or if we were talking about reordering?\n\n Reorder planning. If it's the reorder type planning, then the system will gather the target inventory levels from inventory planning, will gather as well the transactional data, so any open PRs, POs, material reservation, and will gather any constraints. So this, the system will do that in the background, and then inventory control will run the supply planning. The system will then propose, based on algorithms and your need, will propose a plan.\n\n The inventory control will then analyze this plan, and they can perform what-if scenarios. So this is basically we're saying we're changing the inputs in order to to check how the supply plan will impact it. If we need to adjust it, then we go back to the what-if scenario or what-if analysis to compare as well the results. Once this is done, we consolidate the plan with the advanced planning. The difference between your advanced planning and the other point is that in advanced planning, we're gathering the Um.\n\n The final demand plan. But the rest it will be the same. So we're gathering your open. The system will gather the open PRS inventory reservations, uh, and, uh, any constraints. So what? Once this is club or consolidated. Then it will go to the inventory manager to review the supply plan. If there's any adjustment, then we the inventory controller who made those adjustments. And then once that plan is finally approved, the system will then create purchase requisitions, stock transfers, and call off orders.\n\n And then you go into your processing, PO processing, and S4 HANA."},{"start_time":1731569126493,"end_time":1731569128511,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Are there any questions?"},{"start_time":1731569128511,"end_time":1731569161525,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Yeah, in this process, next time, can you identify which one performed by system and which one is performed by the inventory controller because I don't understand which one will be by system which one by the inventory controller because you say example 17 adjustments required this is what this is the results from the IVP the inventory controller to decide whether to adjust or not or yes yes the adjustment automatically I don't understand so the IVP will give you would"},{"start_time":1731569161525,"end_time":1731569190545,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 4"},"words":"provide you let's I think that's a good point.

Based upon your understanding of how this rig planning impacts, if you have this data in system like if if the materials are common between what rigs you have and what rigs you will have in future then see there has to be some input to system that how the what is the impact of new rig in the planning if it is a new material getting added we are already have a separate process of new material introduction where we can what we are proposing is use a similar material for historical consumption so that we Now, if it is an existing material, you know the impact of rig on existing material.\n\n You can increase the forecast manually so that adjustment happens to the demand side.
