Okay, hi again everyone. So, as I said, we will, before we went to the break, we will start reviewing a few examples. Okay, we will start with the gamma distribution, which is characterized by a high deviation, by a high variance. Then we will jump into the normal distribution example. And finally, we'll jump into the Poisson, which is for materials with rare consumption, which is the example that we will review that, as I said, have one consumption every five years and a lead time of nine months.\n\n So the idea is that first, I'm going to show you an Excel to be as transparent as possible with the calculations that the system performs. And then having a clear idea of how the system works in an Excel sheet, we will jump into the system where Hector will show us all the details. So let's start with gamma. As I said, the monthly average of this product is of 20 units, lead time of one month, and standard deviation of 12.\n\n So this is the curve that characterize of, let's start with the demand. This is an example of demand for 20 units. Four periods with a curve that follows the gamma distribution. So as you can see, the pattern is pretty, is reasonably flat. Sorry, I need to put, this is the average. 20, okay. So it falls around the average, but then it had sudden jumps. So as I was explaining before, you have, I don't know, an average consumption or a median consumption of 20.\n\n And then all of a sudden, you have this consumption of around 75. So if we look at the probability curve, using, for example, with a safety stock, let's say of 20 units, we cover pretty much of like a pretty considerable area of the curve. But then it gets harder and harder to capture all the cases because we have these sudden jumps. So it's really hard to calculate the safety stock. So now let's jump into the calculation.\n\n So as I said, standard deviation of 20 and monthly average of 20. Standard deviation of 12, sorry. And service level of 95%. And how we get, how we, well, we have this, the cumulative probability and which is for all the service level. So the system go into the curve, like iterating somehow, until it gets the 95%. As you can see here, we get exactly 95% for the three units. So this is what we have here.\n\n Well, it's a little bit lower than that, 42 units. And the safety stock is 22 minus the demand during the average. Okay. If we change level for example 19% of course 90% of course the reorder point will go down. With 90% again if we go here to 90% we will be here it will be 37."},{"start_time":1729761317998,"end_time":1729761320562,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"That's the reorder point."},{"start_time":1729761320562,"end_time":1729761338347,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah the reorder point.

All I care is if my inventory goes below the reorder point, then I trigger replenishment.

So we have chemicals as one of the demand streams, we have projects, which is more of a turnaround as a demand stream, and we have regular MRO, which is corrective and preventive maintenance as demand streams. So when we are collating all the demands, if a material which is part of all the three demands, let's take an example of a material which is part of turnaround, which is part of regular consumption, and which is part of, say, chemicals as well.\n\n I don't know if you will have such a situation, but then if that's the case, which means that if it is part of all three, you will have a certain demand which is a regular consumption then you have a certain demand, which is corrective consumption, which is intermittent in nature. And then do you have a certain demand, which is like once in three years, which is coming from our projects. So this three demands needs to be identified separately.\n\n Now what IBP expects that from a historical consumption, it will look at what has been consumed. We can segment the consumption, historical consumption based on what exact consumption has been. Like if it is chemical, it is the movement type would be different it would be good issue to a reservation then we know that okay this is the consumption in terms of regular consumption for chemicals when it is projects we expect there should be a different consumption to a project work order which means we can segregate okay this is the consumption history of a work order when it is an MRO we expect there should be a consumption history where it says that consumption against a maintenance order it can be corrective or preventive, which means we know that, OK, these three different demand inputs are there.\n\n And based upon these three demand inputs, we can then tell what is the regular, what should be the purchase, which would be covering one of those. Now, this is history. So from a history, we tell. But we also need an input that chemical will have a separate input which says that this is my forecast for chemicals in terms of whatever manual Excel sheet we are talking about. We will know from projects planning or the turnaround planning that this is an additional demand over chemicals from projects which needs to be planned.\n\n And then whatever is the corrective or MRO demand, which would be again forecasted separately.

So we wanted to show that Excel, because it's very interactive, and then you can see the different charts related to that. In the system, it's going to be much more flat, let's say, because you will have the inputs, and then you run an algorithm, and directly you get the outputs. So for you that haven't been exposed In IVP, you have two environments.\n\n The main one is the Excel-based, and then you have also in the web that is very similar to the S4 environment because they are based on the same platform design. But all that you see here, this is called a planning view, and basically it's a template. It's an Excel spreadsheet, very similar to what you can be using right now. The main difference is that this is connected to the Cloud. Information you see here is an IDP in an external server, let's say, and you can bring the information that you want to see and only that.\n\n You don't need to have all the information of the planning, but only a specific sample you want to see or all the information you want to see, basically. So this is going to be like a Bible table. All that you see here can be changed. The hierarchies you see here. Here you are seeing a part number, for example. It can be, of course, a you have the plant, you have some segmentation that is telling you this is a smoother distribution type is telling you the system we are going to use the normal distribution in this case and so on.\n\n So all the information that is in such a way related to our planning dimensions are the chemicals, the materials, sorry, the plants and so on. So all the information related can be brought So you can use it for seeing it here as complementary information. You can use it as a filtering. You can use it in reports to consolidate the information and so on. So that's one of the possibilities. Then what you see here are the key figure.\n\n These are going to be your inputs, outputs, intermediate information. All that is dependent on time. Also, it's going to be a key figure. It's a number that varies over the time. In this example, we are showing safety stock. We are deploying this kind of time-independent, so we are not showing the horizon, but you can see it certainly for all key fields like stock projection, like forecast, we will see a number changing over the time.\n\n Like any pivot table, you can edit what you want to see. You can filter the horizon, you can filter the information that you see on the view, you can filter the key figures that you see in the view, the layout between columns and rows, you can decide. Filter information as well, what you want to see in that moment, and even alert. In the future, we will see more of this functionality. This is for you just to have a good idea of what we can see on the system and what we are seeing right now.\n\n Now, what I want to show you is that here on IDP, you can define the input. Basically, all that Bastian was showing recently, we have it here. I highlighted right now in green that these are the inputs, the monthly demand rate, the lead time, the service level, the demand standard deviation if we need to account for variability, and all these inputs are going to be considered by some algorithms that we have on ADP.\n\n Let me show you here very quickly. Algorithms that are going to run the inventory optimization. So we have an inventory profile. The naming is just Poisson, but in this case, it's considering everything normal in gamma. We just need to change them. And you can apply some filters if you want to run this just for a specific scenario. If you don't, you can apply for all the cases. When you run this algorithm, then you will get updated recommendations here.\n\n So you have first the safety stock, and then you have also the reorder point, right? If you go with supply planning, you only care about the safety stock. If you will go with the reorder-based planning, you want to see also the reorder point. So this is what the system is going to get you based on these inputs. We have the two examples that Bastian was showing you. Let me filter so it's clear for you.\n\n We have the gamma segmentation. Is something that, sorry, this letter is something that the system is automatically determining based on the segmentations that we are discussing about variability, frequency of consumption. It's going to say the best model for you is gamma. So whenever we run the inventor optimization, it's going to follow that model. For the other case, we have normal distribution.\n\n And whenever we run the model, it's going to run normal distribution. And then for what is going to be exactly the same. For Poisson, we have it on a different tab because we see other things like consumption per year or unit frequency because it's much – it's a slow mover, so we see different gears, but it's going to be about the same. So, you have a demand rate, like in this case consumption per year.\n\n You have a lead time of nine months. This is the expected demand over the lead time in this very slow-moving case, this is the service level that we want to achieve. These are the recommendation that the system is giving to you. Now, something that I want to show you that I think that is very enlightening is that service level is the big input in which we have influence on these numbers. If I open here, because I have prepared this, we have scenarios.\n\n Is a tool where you can plan what if scenarios, that means that you can think, okay, what are going to be the results if my service level is 50 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent, 95, 99, and so on. Let me hide the baseline. You can see that in these different scenarios, they place a different service level, and you can see that the numbers are changing accordingly. Let's focus on this talk. For the normal distribution, if you put 50 percent service-level, zero service-level recommendation.\n\n As soon as you are increasing the service-level, the stock is also increasing. Something very interesting you see here is that here we are incrementing 30 percent to our points. For that, we only need 10 percent 10 additional stock of safety stock units. But if you want to go from 95 to 99, you see that it's increasing. You are only increasing four points, percent of points on service level, but you need nine units.\n\n As the closer you get to the 100 percent service level, the harder is going to be fulfilled that priority. Every time you need more and more stock. Indeed, if you want to put from 99 percent to 100 percent, the amount of stock that you need is a lot and probably it's not sound. It's not economically, it can be done, but it's not going to be a good recommendation from the system."},{"start_time":1729766054231,"end_time":1729766054648,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Good."},{"start_time":1729766054648,"end_time":1729766061313,"speaker":{"name":"Aboobacker M.

When we have the cost, we get the volume multiplied by the cost and we see the financial impact that can be very insightful. You can check, okay, what if I change or increase the service level, what is going to be the financial impact of that decision.\n\n Poisson distribution, the same. The numbers are lower, of course, but you see that as you increase the service level here, you are also increasing the safety stock that you will need for each one of those cases. I don't know, do you have any question? Because the next topic that we want to discuss is about the service level. We have seen a lot that this is a strategic decision, so we need to start thinking how we are going to define it for each case.\n\n For many of the cases, I guess that we don't want to keep any stocks, so we need to exclude them in such a way from the calculation.

But during the different test phases of the project, we will be able to fine-tune the model.\n\n What I mean by that is that if we see that the results we're getting from the Material Master in the case of lead time, is not generating good results and we need to tweak it, we need to adjust it to a more accurate or something like that. I'm just giving an example, but you can apply. Of course, you can find plenty of different examples for this. Then it's part of the testing phase to, first of all, find that and then redefine the definition to, of course, get good results.\n\n So what I'm trying to say here is the definitions that you are not sure about, I think the best way to make the final decision is to jump into the testing phase, look at the results and then say, okay, let's say or check if this works or not. So don't feel like the pressure to make a final we will have several testing phases to confirm that."},{"start_time":1729766617626,"end_time":1729766628771,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Not understood.

It was one of the questions we have before. So as mentioned before, service level is one of the user inputs. We consider this a strategic input in which we can bring factors that we are not considering on the formula. So in the formula you have variability, you have demand rate, you have lead time, but sometimes there are other factors can influence as well if we want to keep very high levels of the stock to cover for many cases or maybe we are willing to take the risk because it's not going to be very impactful.\n\n So service level is going to be defined by a risk score. Risk score basically is telling you, it's trying to measure what is the impact of a stock out for us. So if we have a big impact, we assign a number one, which is core, and we should assign a higher service level for that case. So we need to try to segment our data in such a way that we are able to identify, based on rules, which items should have the higher service level, which items shouldn't have any service level at all.\n\n Because there are going to be many cases in which you don't want to plan. I guess that for the for non-moving, we are not going to plant the stock, so we need to define it in such a way that we can leave it out of the equation. For all the others, we need to define the different levels of service level we want to have. So, I will show you some example of the segmentations you have right here. Take just an example, because we have realizing that MRO sessions that maybe this is not exactly like I'm putting here, but we wanted to run the different segmentations you have, what is the stock-out impact that we can measure out of the segmentations, and based on this, use it as a starting point to define which cases should have the higher service level, which cases should have the lower service level.\n\n It's going to be a mix of this, can include all some additional fields that are not necessarily a segmentation, maybe a characteristic of the material, that for these materials, we don't want to give a stock or for – and"},{"start_time":1729766790008,"end_time":1729766790868,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"so on."},{"start_time":1729766790868,"end_time":1729766881236,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So, our rationale here was that for BEV, that something that is vital, then we need to have the highest service level, because the impact on the operation is immediate, right? So, maybe you want to have the higher service level possible, and with that, the higher safety stock to cover for all the cases that you can in order to avoid the stockout and the impact on the operation, the downtime, and so on.\n\n So, that for us was the initial point. Then, also, we wanted to consider the fast moving – sorry, the frequency segmentation. Of course, the higher the frequency, the most that you are exposed to a stock-out. So because you are withdrawing from a stock very frequently, and that increases a lot the probability of a stock-out. So that is something that we also want to take into consideration. And then there are other segmentations that we can consider or not, like the consumption value, ABC, or the unitary price.\n\n I don't know if that applies here. Holding value that is less impactful and lead time segmentation that is much less impactful because we are considering the lead time to the equation. So, I wouldn't recommend to go there. We need to think – I don't think that we are going to define it today with the time that we have and with the many companies you have right now."},{"start_time":1729766881236,"end_time":1729766899539,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"I think that this is – I think one parameter is missing over here, which may be important, business continuity we have some materials which are which are like business continuity Jagash that should be one of the parameters in in"},{"start_time":1729766899539,"end_time":1729766907558,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"identifying you know whether the material is available and the service level also right Jaga."},{"start_time":1729766907558,"end_time":1729766911301,"speaker":{"name":"Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Yes yes definitely we should add them."},{"start_time":1729766911301,"end_time":1729766914509,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Very high first similar like criticality."},{"start_time":1729766914704,"end_time":1729766917391,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Is this a custom field, VC?"},{"start_time":1729766917391,"end_time":1729766937996,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"No, it's a standard.

Then if it is not vital but it's then you want to check maybe the frequency segmentations.\n\n If it is fast moving and also is an A because it's very high value, we put it as a two. If it's not high value, we put it as a three and so on. You understand the point. Desirable, non-moving, they are like last priority. They shouldn't receive any stock, et cetera. So we need to come up with something like this We can give you a template in which we start maybe with just a suggestion of what should be the hierarchies.\n\n We were considering this tree at the beginning. You can discard them. You can add additional ones like the one that Vignesh was proposing. If it's not a segmentation, you need to propose as well like a material classification, etc. That's what we want to achieve. Let's try to have this by by AGCs to have as an initial input, but then later, let's try to consolidate in just one rule for the whole business if possible.\n\n We are trying to have something very standardized.
