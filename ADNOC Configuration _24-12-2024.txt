Can you see my screen? Yeah. So we have here, maybe I will put a different color. Where is it? Where is it? Yeah, I put it here. So we have Okay, someone changing, who changed this? Okay, it doesn't matter, but the thing is that we have the MVP creation and the date is the 10th of January. This is the, probably this will get delayed by two weeks.\n\n I mean, all the plan, the entire plan and will get delayed two weeks. So instead of the 10 of January will be the 24th. I will say most likely the 17th. So we'll have one more week to create the MVP. So basically using the units, I think we have two things, two inputs here to the script. We have of course the VRD and we also have the testing conditions in the VPD. Okay, so the idea is during the configuration sprint 3, we have two weeks for that, is to start creating in the MVP, the MVP script.\n\n And of course, with that also create the user cases. I mean, is it gonna be basically the users have to follow, perform by themselves the user cases, but these cases are already prepared. It's like a rehearsal of what's gonna be their role using AVP, right? I think it will be nice if you can, of course, use IWLT for this, and then VBECU for supply can come up with a proposal for the MVP script, and then we can review it all together.\n\n I mean, I think it's pretty much, I mean, we have all the pieces, which is the VRD and the testing conditions, or test conditions. We need to give, what will be my approach is to create in the test, in the BRD, a priority of the main, of the MVP, like of the requirements saying, okay, priority one means that this has to be an MVP. Priority two, we can park this for the future. And priority three, same, but yeah.\n\n And then make sure that those requirements are covered in the test conditions. If they're not covered, then we need to add more testing conditions. And maybe there is the case that there is more things in testing conditions than we actually need.
