Hector Palacios:
Hello, Omar? You there? Hi, Ike, how are you? Doing well, man.

Omar Essam:
How are you doing?

Hector Palacios:
It's good, I'm fine. Are you good?

Omar Essam:
Glad to hear that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, how are you?

Hector Palacios:
Doing well, doing well. I'm like, all the Fridays I'm at the office. So this is, I don't know if you can see my camera, make it work yeah this is like uh it's like a tiny space that we have for I don't know one for when I need a meeting there is like a very tiny space let me show you uh I think that I here I can yeah so you see so those are the offices and you see this space is very tiny so it's like ah it's like focus room to have a meeting or something right yeah I I think I here we can have four people but usually is when I want to have a I want to be alone you know you have to yeah really sorry but is this office is near to you or not 30 minutes uh let's see 40 minutes 40 minutes 40 minutes by subway or like train in train but a little bit farther but for example for Bastian that is one of my co-workers he's living like 10 minutes in train you know so the point is that these offices are very well connected are great so the the last ones that you didn't you didn't have the opportunity to go there because they they were not great and it was difficult to get there it's like you you needed to catch like three trains you know And this one is a like a very central note on Madrid It's very near to

Omar Essam:
Office, right? Office. Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, they are here at the front I think but well, I don't go there because this is more on the sales side Usually, you know SAP when you talk about the SAP offices, they are sales people. It's not like people I think the core probably is in Germany on the India, I think So the ones that usually interact with them is Cesar, Sikiel, you know? Yeah. So man, hopefully you can come here one day. I think that...



Omar Essam:
Yes, actually I'm not sure, but actually I'm thinking to come to Madrid like two days because I will be in Morocco in Feb, I think. If I manage to do it, I will be coming like maybe on thursday and friday so I could meet you in the office yeah you can come yeah but I'm still not sure but I for sure I would be

Hector Palacios:
coming like before me for sure it's going to happen some event was cm that you you will be able to come I don't think that's going to be an issue so you can get to know the guys that we

Omar Essam:
have here as well yeah yeah so I'm very happy that everything worked out yes I'm very happy I'm excited because like the discussion with Philippe was very good and he showed like support and interest to support and showed also interest to expand the people, expand the team here in Egypt. Already Abdurrahman will be joining the company and even Yara told me that there is some other consultant to be joined.

 She is a girl expected to join also. I met her like just to explain in the process of how it's being done. And I'm really excited to be joining another project. Also, last two weeks, we were in Pharma. I had more responsibility related to inventory and supply. It just started to involve me in inventory since Juan already had a paternity leave because he just had his son. So I'm really waiting for more responsibilities and potential.

 And I really got also this work it out discussion like Philip, you showed the support, hit me out. What do you want? I want to support. If you want to be involved in sales, I'm really happy to do this. So I think I'm really happy that they have like this opportunity to be supported and be involved in more opportunities and more projects, not only as a consultant, but also as a someone that the company is trusting.

 And for sure. A lot for supporting the discussion through these two weeks. It was very exhausting to me, to be honest, and very stressful.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, it wasn't a very bad idea to tell them.

Omar Essam:
Yeah, so thank you a lot for doing this.

Hector Palacios:
But, you know, I mean, this is... Each of us is strategic, so I think that maybe we failed to make you feel like it was an important position, because maybe you felt alone sometimes, maybe you saw not getting this like, I don't know, it's like a case like India that you have like some spot consultants, but it's not like that. It's a strategic place for OECM. So it's very likely that in the future, in Cairo, we have a hub of consultants like we are doing here in Madrid.

 And if you are one of the first ones, that is only good. That is only good. So you are going to roll out all the opportunities you have. Automatically, you have the advantage because one, you are the most senior guy that we have on Egypt. And second, you have a geographic advantage. You know, it's not easy to bring talent from all places in the world to come to Egypt, to come to Madrid. It's difficult.

 Right. So that means that there are going to be opportunities that you are going to easily, you know, so that you need to grab these opportunities. And so, yeah, I'm really happy because at least I saw the commitment on Felipe and everyone that, yes, for us, Egypt is strategic. We like Omar. We want that Omar is probably the leader in the future in the zone. So you need to take the opportunity, man.

 The other company, maybe it was a good idea. Maybe it was a good company as well. But it's not in the development that you need to go. It's like what we were discussing, right? When you enter in the right moment, you start growing with the company. So this is the right moment. This is when the company is like a startup. This is like the good position that then later in the future, you're going to be a manager.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So this is it.

Hector Palacios:
And I saw that the salary is also good.

Omar Essam:
Yes, it's better. It's actually, yes, it's like, I think it's like the whole situation was better. It's better right now. Like the salary is good. The communication also, I think like I got a commitment from Philippe that okay, we will be supporting the communication. And he also told me that for any next project, I will be sure that I will communicate to the VM of the project that we not just need to implement the project, we need to like have good consultants, not only good projects.

 We need to have good consultants as a preferred. And also the promises about development and expansion. So this is what I need. I think this is like, in two years, as I told you, I'm just afraid that in two years or three years I will not be able to achieve what I'm expecting to achieve for myself. But I really ask the Philippines to be involved with international projects. Any project in Egypt I wanted to be involved with.

 And I promised him that he will be able to see commitment. So commitment, as long as I see commitment from the company, I already see commitment from the company to develop my meme. So I will be very keen to do, should like to be up to this trust and be up to this confidence that the company had given to me. Yeah, that's right.

Hector Palacios:
I am really happy for that, Because that's the way that we felt when we were on Chile. Like guys like me, Sebastian, you know, that we entered being like, you know, just out of the college. And we felt like they were like taking big stakes on us, you know? So you feel important, right? You feel that, yeah, they are trusting you that you are going to do great in the future and you are going to be in a good position.

 To go with the company. So I see something very similar in Egypt. A little bit more challenging, yes, for sure. Because in Chile we have architects and all of that. In Egypt you are on your own. The good news is that now we have the remote working and people from all parts of the world can communicate with you. So that's a big difference, I guess. But it's a good position, man. It's a good position.

 I think that you took a good decision staying here.

Omar Essam:
Yes, I hope so. I hope so. I'm really preparing myself for the new projects, trying to study more, trying to read more, trying to capture the insights coming from Elcio and Santi, to be ready for the new project. Yeah, to be ready.

Hector Palacios:
So let me discuss the next step, because now happening with us is that in this new position, a lot of things are changing, right? So, you know, you have another, you have another level, consultant level, I think that is experience consultant. I sent the email they told you. So that means that now you your promotions are like once in a year, because I think that before one level, I think consultant two, you have like twice a year, something like that.

 But now you are in this level, it's like me, that you go like once a year. I don't go in the promotions anymore, but it's like all the senior consultants go once in a year. The good news is that we don't need to worry about the rates.

Omar Essam:
No, it's fair enough actually. So it makes sense to request another promotion. It's fair enough.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, the point with the promotions is that at the beginning when you have new consultants, you want to give them the opportunity to start growing a lot in a faster pace. But it's not like you are getting that money and promotion. Indeed, it's like the yearly promotion is the same amount of money that if you do it twice, you know, it's just the half the amount. But now if you promote the next year, you get like the double that expecting, you know what I mean?

 So that means that you entered for the next cycle, the following one, this one, this one of Cornos, because you already have the big promotion right now. So next year, June 6th is your your promotional cycle. That means that we don't worry about the grades now. We don't have that issue. So if you want to do the PM course, now you do it in your site. I mean, if you want to do it, we are not going to wait one year for that, right?

 So just do that. Let me think. Maybe it's not a bad idea to wait after the promotional cycle. So if you do the certification, we can count out that as a grade either way. So you have one. Now, it's very likely that the grades are going to disappear. It's very likely. But either way, just in case. I don't know if for you it's a big deal to wait to do it on March.

Omar Essam:
Anyway, I will I'm planning to do it in April like after I'm done.

Hector Palacios:
So anyway on plan All right so it's not going to be an issue and we can uh, if we continue with the grace we can use it for the for the next promotional cycle and the voters, um, I think that is still a good idea, man especially if you want to because I'm working in the waters with my consultant here in Spain, Pablo. You met Pablo, right? Yes, I met him. Yeah, yeah, with Pablo and I've been supporting him.

 He's going to take the, he's going to demonstrate the next week probably. And it's a good exercise. It's very good. So at least you have some practice, like a very, one very easy exercise, but where you see most of the supply, I think that it is still a good idea, but for sure it's something that we can do in

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
our pace.

Hector Palacios:
So if you want to start learning as soon as possible, I think let's go. Let's have meetings together. Let's try to solve this issue together. So I can teach you whatever it doesn't seem like easy. And we do it, but no pressure. We don't have that pressure. Like we have before. What else? Did they tell you about the, because they were promising someone to teach you something about supply, right? In the email I saw that Felipe was proposing someone to help you with supply planning or to teach about supply planning.

 I don't remember let me check the email.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Give me one second.

Hector Palacios:
So it's just to do a follow-up on the things that they are saying, right?

Omar Essam:
Actually, I'm planning with Ezio to have some session with him for all the page planning. We were supposed to do this in Egypt, but we were very busy and some topics related to inventory optimization. Right now, I'm more involved with inventory optimization, which is something good also to be like revise this concept and have more understanding for these concepts. But I'm planning to have some session with the ASU for order-based planning.

 For supply and time series, I'm still trying to figure out what is happening from the current project, because already Sante computed his check the SAP documentation for supply of time series. I would say it is not that hard for a distribution company to understand, because the concept is very, very simple. It's more about how much you stock or how much stock, how much independent demand. And according to the capacity and according to the current stock in hand, you are doing the optimized running of his heuristic or infinite supply planning.

 So it is not that hard. But I think for more complex concepts, like if you have some components, if you have some families, if you have some subcomponents, it will be more harder and more complex. So I would recommend something else. Maybe if you have participated in another project with such concept of supplies, which you have like two, three or two layers of material like finished goods.

Hector Palacios:
For example, the exercise that I'm doing right now with Paolo, it has the finished goods, it has the semi-finished goods, and then you have the raw materials. So we have the three layers. It's a good exercise, man. So if we want to understand, I think that is much better with practice than with theory. So that is an option for sure, but let's take our time to do it in the in the best moment right now you tell me that you are full with inventory right I also saw you asking some questions I think on the I don't know if it goes in group or on the other group yeah it's a name on spanish it's like um big table it's called small people yeah small table it's like now it's like table because we are many in that.

 It started like for the consultants in Argentina but it was like all of them were analyzing their time and they created this group to ask to us and now they are like 40 people there. Yeah but man if you had any question about inventory I understand a lot about that. So outside of the planning I I think that is one of my strengths. I learned a lot, like some years ago. Now I'm working for the MRO version of this, that is a little bit more simple, but still I have the knowledge of many of the concepts of inventory planning.

 Maybe one of two key fears are new, that maybe I don't remember perfectly all the key fears, For sure, I can help you a lot.

Omar Essam:
So if you have any questions, just tell me. OK. Actually, this week, I have some key figures to configure and also some dashboards. So probably maybe Tuesday, I could send you some questions. And maybe we have like a 15-minute call to discuss.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah. So are you going to work with analytic stories?

Omar Essam:
Yes, analytic stories and also weekly. I'm pretty good at that. Yeah. Yeah, I really did actually as a part of demand and it was good. But I'm still not familiar with like the concept I need to show in the next story for inventory. So I will be working on this. And also I will configure some key figures. So I will, I think I will be having, I will need to show it to you. Also, there is some concept I'm still not understand.



Hector Palacios:
Maybe I will.

Omar Essam:
Could I share my screen?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
So I was checking the email, Omar, and I think that you will have one mentoring session with Felipe, but they are not telling you how to play tanning. So if you need technical support for learning about the modules, use me. I know a lot. This is much better than in supply planning, but I can support you a lot in other aspects.

Omar Essam:
Yes, sure, sure. I will ask you a question. Okay. For me, it's a little bit hard to understand what's the meaning of additional input, like doing additional input. Why I'm doing additional input.

Hector Palacios:
The additional input don't sync on the PBR. The PBR is just a proxy let's say. In the additional input what is important is the table behind the planning level. So in this case the information that you have is at the calendar week level, right? So you are saying basically take this information and it's like a code copy this aggregation but in a key figure calculation. Imagine that you take this information at the core week level and you copy in another key figure that is at the week per log level with a copy this aggregation.

 So for week A and B, you will get exactly the same value that you have on the calendar week.

Omar Essam:
But it's always used in that week, in that way, like in calendar week and week level, right?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, basically you are bringing a value that you have at a higher layer to a lower level and that keyfigure is only opening the combinations, but what is important is the planning level, not the keyfigure. It could be PBR, it could be the same shift, the stock keyfigure, whatever, it doesn't matter. So it's only opening combinations and the way that you open is just to copy the information below.

 It's not a equal parts disaggregation or proportion? No, it's a copy disaggregation basically, but without a copy operator in configuration. Okay, I got you.

Omar Essam:
And here is important because the calendar week, you know, is not communicated to the month.

Hector Palacios:
That's the whole reason why you have technical weeks, right? So you take the information from calendar week to technical week and now you can do whatever Regation you want in two months into years and so on Okay, another question actually inventory because for inventory in like there is a

Omar Essam:
complain a little bit that the level of stock is a little bit high the level of safety stock a little bit high compared to the demand and When I deep dive in this I just found out that because it's focused error is very very high and That's why the safety stock itself is very high. But I found out that also the safety stock, the focused error is very high because we are, the inventory optimizer is calculating safety stock according to focused error, according to weak level.

 Because optimizer is working at weak level. So my question is, can we run the optimizer of inventory optimization on monthly level to have lower focused error? No, not at the monthly level.

Hector Palacios:
The optimizer is going to work at the weekly level always. What I have done in the past is that if the process is more on a monthly basis and they really care to have good safety stock on a monthly basis, you can calculate the error at a monthly basis. That's one option. Now, there are new options, I think, that also are calculating the error, but during the leap time. So I'm not completely sure if that is only for MRO or it's in general.

 But if you calculate during the leap time, you have an aggregation as well. So it's much better to calculate in the single point. So that is an option. But what I did on a past project is that, is that the weekly variation is too high. And I prefer to calculate this based on the, sorry, I forgot the point, based on the monthly number. So I calculated a monthly number, and well, basically that was the input for the error.



Omar Essam:
And I think if you made everything on monthly, if you made most of the factors on monthly like the lead time variation, the forecast error, the demand variance. If you made all these factors being calculated on monthly level, you will be having safety stock, constant safety stock on weekly level, right?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, so you will still have the stock at the weekly level, the coefficient of variation of the error, Also, you will calculate it at the monthly level, but will be downloaded to the weekly level as well. That measure is kind of a dimension. It's a temporal, let's say. But the point is that when you think on that safety stock level, you should later measure your service level, because the service level is how many times you were able to fulfill the demand.

 And the safety stock is there to help. But if you calculate that number at the monthly level, then your service level should also measure at the monthly level. That's the whole point. Because maybe in one week, you are going to have a stock out. But the question is, at the monthly level, was I able to deliver everything? If the question is yes, then it's okay because you got created a safety stock for the month bucket, not for the weekly.

 So yeah, that's the point. Now, also, this is a little bit more tricky, calculating the coefficient of variation. I'm finding out, for example, now working with the spare parts, that if you base your standard deviation based on the error, it's much worse. What you want to achieve is the other way around, is you want to measure the error instead of measuring the variability of the demand only, of the actuals.

 Why? Because imagine that you have a seasonal demand, right? Variability is high of the demand because it's seasonal. So you have big peaks, you have very low valleys, so the dispersion from the mean is usually high, the standard deviation is high, then the coefficient of variation is high. But that doesn't mean that it's difficult to forecast. It can be seasonal, but very predictable, right? Like, I don't know, ice cream in winter is very low, ice cream in summer is very high.

 It's predictable, you know, because it's very related to the weather, to the season. That's why they try to measure the error, because they say, if it can be seasonal, but can be very forecastable, that means that the error should be kind of similar across the year. It doesn't matter that you are in high season or low season. The error is an indicator that this is predictable. So you want to measure what is the variability of the error, because this is going to tell how difficult it is to predict.

 And if it is easy to predict, then you should have low safety stock. If it's difficult to predict, you should have high safety stock. That's the whole idea. That's why we are calculating the safety stock based on error. That's the core reason. But this is going to work fine only for continuous demand. If you have cases in which you have intermittent demand, probably this is going to backfire to you.

 For intermittent demand, I would suggest let's try to calculate only the variability of the demand because otherwise you are going to increase the error and it's going to be much worse. That's my recommendation in that regard. But other than that, we need to see numbers. Maybe next week when you want to have Maybe we can check to hear some numbers. And I can tell you, OK, yeah, this is not looking fine.



Omar Essam:
Maybe we should do this or the other way around. But I think for most of the projects, for most of the projects, the factors or the clients, they order cycle on a monthly basis. So it's like supply planning on a monthly basis. And it's always weekly. Calculating inventory on a monthly basis. So it's like I always end up, let me share something.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, so I remember that I did, when I did this on this company, that was the same situation. And I made sure doing the calculations so we can get it like, it's like trying to simulate at weekly level the results that you would get at the monthly level. I think that you can do You can do it.

Omar Essam:
Yeah, but you see my screen, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Omar Essam:
So it's like this is the focus. The client is requesting something between 21 or 25 days. But so this is a weekly receipt. And this is three months of the focus, three weeks of the focus. They always need three weeks of the focus as a safety stop. So this is like 20, 20, 30, so this is 70 here. Is 100, so this is 100, and this is 1010. So because they always make supply planning on month. That is not a safety stock, man.



Hector Palacios:
It's a different concept. That is more on the hand. It's more like to stock on hand. So safety stock. No. We have to open it.

Omar Essam:
This is like safety. This is a stock opening. And I know what you mean. This is like safety stock. To have it to protect you from the variation of the demand and service level.

Hector Palacios:
Yes, but it's a more like a rule of thumb, it's a rule of thumb like a policy. It's a stock policy, it's just a naming convention because safety stock for you is not what is going to because that safety stock is going to satisfy demand in inventory and supply plan. It's going to be used for supplying as well. Safety stock is something that at the planning level, you shouldn't touch. You are having safety stock for the reality.

 But in the planning, hopefully, you are not using never the safety stock. It's always like a buffer that you have as a minimum, but it's not meant to use. This is what you call target coverage or days of stock or weeks of stock, weeks of sales, they have many names, but basically it's having enough stock to cover the forecast of the next three, next five, next six periods. So it's a different measure.

 So if you calculate, for example, the safety stock from IVP and you compare it with this, you are comparing like apple with oranges because they are not the same concept. One is target coverage that they can call it safety stock if they want, but it's not like the book or the textbook definition of what is safety stock. Safety stock is a little part of that, that covers only for uncertainty, but not for the demand.

 So that is more similar to the stock on hand, basically.

Omar Essam:
Yeah, but even though, even the safety stock, I understand your concern, but even though if the supply of safety stock is being calculated on weekly level and the supply being done on monthly level, always end up with very high stock in the first week of the month because you will request the maximum of the healthy stock of the whole, of the three, of the four weeks in Euro stock plus Euro demand.

 You got my point, right?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, no, but what I'm expecting from the safety stock is the safety stock is going to be little. And aside of the safety stock, you need to have the cycle stock. The cycle stock is made for supplying the demand. So if you have this amount of demand then the cycle stock is what you're saying right now. It's basically that. But also you have a little buffer. This what they are doing is not optimal.

 It's not what IBP is made for. I mean you can do it but if you have inventory planning module you are not expecting to use that. Maybe you can use it at the beginning but eventually they having inventory planning start using safety stock. So you should transition to that idea, right? Because if you have the inventory module, then why you are having it if you can just calculate with a simple formula the inventory coverage, right?



Omar Essam:
Yes, you're right. Actually, we are pushing this now with them. And we already discussed that we will review the numbers again of the optimizer. Because they are saying it's a little bit high but actually it's like it's like coming from the system or coming from their focus because their focus is very bad so it's always with high error so that's why and they are requesting very high service level it's like 90 or 95 percent so that's why safety stock is very high.



Hector Palacios:
Okay but let's look for women I mean that that is something that we can compare but we need to have the we need to find the way of comparing the inventory results with this policy. It's not comparing safety stock with this because they are not the same. We need to use another measure. Let's have a session next week. Because now I need to jump to a weekly status meeting that I have with my project on El Salvador.

 So I need to leave you, but let's have this meeting the next week and let's discuss about that. Because I can't help you with that, man.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Omar Essam:
Thank you, Hector.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right.

Hector Palacios:
Thank you, Mark.

Omar Essam:
See you. Bye. See you. Bye.

Hector Palacios:
Bye!
