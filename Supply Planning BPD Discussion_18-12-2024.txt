If you remember, we have received a comment related to the material type, MRP type, as well as which all movement types we need to consider for that. So basically, this is the new process completely for them. Single person is going to manage the demand planning, inventory planning, as well as the supply planning. Currently, all the three processes they are doing in S4 HANA.\n\n They know each and every input for the material master, especially like which MRP type.

So these are nothing but the individual process activity which we have captured in detail and how it is going to get executed via IVP theory app.\n\n So here I don't see any challenge. The problem is that in the process description section here. Here we need to set the context. So directly we are jumping to the IVP planning type. So they don't know what will happen to my existing MRP type. So for Realtor Point, they are using custom MRP type. For normal MRP planning in S4 HANA, they are using another MRP type. So here first we need to set the context that this is your as is MRP type and in the 2b and here we have mentioned learning technique reorder point definition but what will be the proposed one so that is the design part which we need to mention whatever nomenclature you need to define that is perfectly fine because ultimately this is the MRP right right what I understand from this which will be coming from S4 HANA only because let's say if you are maintaining the same MRP type you are not changing the Metal Mastery in S4 HANA.\n\n And by accidently, if any planner is executing MRP in S4 HANA, either classic MRP or MRP-Live, so they'll get the requirement generated in S4 HANA. So to avoid that part, we need to create a custom MRP type for that. So that we need to mention in detail here. As is, as well as a 2Me MRP type in the form of IVP planning technique.

The approval mechanism in IBP is to approve the supply plan. Now, once you create a purchase order through IBP, the purchase order will again go through approval in S4 HANA as per the value of the purchase. Sorry, purchase requisition will go through approval in S4 per the value of purchase requisition. But if you want to approve every purchase order in IBP before it gets created, which means for every PR triggered by IBP, this approval email should be triggered.\n\n So do you think IBP has the ability that for every PR to be triggered from IBP, based upon the value of the PR, it will trigger approval mechanisms for every PR?

That should be the stance from our side. But also when it comes to creating PRs from IBP, what I'm hearing is that there is not a very good way of controlling which PRs get created. The only way it can be done is through filters.\n\n And then probably we'll have to, once we show them with data, that's where we can more about how they want us to execute.

So they're not going to accept this solution. So that also we need to clarify during the build phase.\n\n So here we just need to write how it will be done, and only at a plan level, not at an individual order level, as we just discussed.

And they already have a program in S4HANA to do it, which means there is the logic available.

The logic of the consolidation that you're mentioning. So right now, the consolidation logic is in S4 HANA, which they are doing today. And their expectation is the same consolidation when the PR gets created for IBP also, the consolidation logic So ultimately, they see the PR based upon, say, one PR per vendor. So if there are 10 materials from the same vendor, then all the PRs of the vendor should be created as a single PR and not 10 different PRs.\n\n I'm just giving a simplified example. But this logic is there in S4 HANA, because when the outcome of MRP comes, MRP creates an independent PR for each material. And then they run this custom program to consolidate all those PRs into a single PR, then which gets distributed.

See batch management you have clearly explained in the comment response I have seen. To the asthma that batch management anyway we cannot bring in IBP because batch management it is more of an execution part so it is predominantly used in S4HANA or EWM system to define the FIFO or FIFO logic last in first out or first in first out or expiration based on that yeah now if batch we are not able to bring in then whatever inventory at an aggregate level are we able to give the visibility to them that these are the volume which is going to get expired maybe in near future after six months.\n\n So based on that they can take the action or if required they can also trigger the supply planning at S4HANA side. So this kind of provision they are expecting from IBP to be done. So based on your understanding whatever is possible that we need to document it and then we can showcase to them in the chemical BP. And for that, you also need a master data, which will be coming from material master.

It's for like other industries, like a milk and so on, because they are very short shelf life and use this, but you are losing a lot of functionalities, like moving a stock from one plant to another that AdNoc wants to have.\n\n So it is not that they can have this functionality.

In supply planning, how are you going to differentiate that the purchase, let's say the plan, supply plan, forget about the purchase equation, the plan which is going to get generated, it is only for the turnaround and not for the corrective maintenance or the preventive maintenance.\n\n So that we need to segregate. So this also we need to mention as a part of our solution approach, which we can see it is missing in MRO here. In our documentation. So I suggest to refer to the BID also, wherever it is very critical. And we need to also define the proper solution approach concept. At least the concept part, how we're going to approach it.
