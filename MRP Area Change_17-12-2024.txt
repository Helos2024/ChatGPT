So, what we are proposing is basically, so I will start from the more functional side, and then we will address the definitions we need to make, okay?\n\n So, okay, if we follow the proposed plan, we should be starting this week, we should be here, basically, okay? Meaning that in the This, in reality, is already happening, and it will take three weeks, okay? Then sprint two, the configuration, or I think the most important thing here is that, well, we have three sprints of configuration, then we have a unit testing MVP with manually loaded data, then the UIT, But for the SIT, we need to have all the integration done.\n\n So this is the key date. This is a key date, the 24th of February. So basically, if we follow this plan until here, we need to have definitions for the integration and the master data generation for the integration, right? I mean, because they don't have the BOM, and well, they are now changing it, but let's assume they're going to build a BOM.

So if we come back here, the question is, when do you think, and it's something that we need to iterate here, Sagar.\n\n When do you think we need the definitions? We need the definition basically to build the integration. So basically, we need to have the definitions and then build the integration. We have 10 weeks for that. Of course, you're not going to be the only one building the integration. In that sense, don't think that you if they make it two weeks before, I think this is, I mean, this has to be done as soon as possible.\n\n So you can have, I don't know, let's say they have to do it in the next two weeks.

They should have the data ready at least is a subset of data. So in this case, it will be 11 weeks, 11 preparations plus three internal testing. So three internal testing means they are going to maintain some extra data Yeah, so meaning that in this first 11 weeks from now, they're preparing the data and then in the last three weeks before the SAT execution, we can test, I don't know, test the integration because they're going to have the data and make any adjustments needed.\n\n We can make it maybe 10 plus 4. Okay. Sounds better. I'm going to share with you a plan that looks better, but I think for now it looks like seven weeks for building the integration, having definitions, and then four weeks in which we'll be able to adjust and test internally.
