This time we are going to pick where we left in the last session. If you remember, we were discussing about the supply planning on We have two sessions of that, and in the second one, we were discussing about the demo. So the idea is to continue with the demo. Just to align the expectations, we still have demo data. It would be ideal for us to have also the real data.\n\n The problem is that there is an intrinsic challenge for that. We are working on that. It's going to be part of the following parts of the project. Following phases on the configuration, but there is an intrinsic challenge in doing that and we are working on having data as soon as possible, but it's not going to be as soon as you have it today. For today, we will show examples with dummy data. I hope that they are realistic.\n\n Let me share the screen and let me showcase what we want to achieve today. This that you see here are all the scenarios that we are planning for today. Last session, we spent some time on showing the different interfaces. If you remember, we have an Excel interface that we are going to see a lot today, and also we have some web interfaces in which you can see dashboards and that kind of stuff. We are going to skip that for today because we think that we have a lot to show and we know that we take our time on these kind of things.\n\n Then later on the session, Bastian will show you an example of the actual consumption versus reservations. This is something that comes from the last discussion that we were having. You are saying that many times we have reservations, and then we have PRs, and the PRs are canceled. So the accuracy of those reservations is not the best. Bastian will show you how we can analyze that on IDP with simple indicators, KPIs.\n\n We also will check the material reservations. If you remember the first example that we were discussing, we were stuck on the forecasting part, and we were showing how the material reservation with the forecast conciliate. We can touch base very quickly on that. Hopefully, we are not going to be stuck on that point. Then later, we want to show you some examples of advanced flight planning with open POs and PRs, the same for reorder point planning.\n\n And in all the examples, probably you will see of transfer proposals that are the STRs and the procurement proposal that are the PRs. Finally, Bastian is going to show you some examples related when we have multiple vendors, load sizes, quota arrangements, lead time. He will explain when we get to that part of the demo and also some alerts monitoring that we can have. For example, when we are not able to fulfill completely demand or when we are not able to fulfill the inventory target.\n\n That is usually for us to save the stock. So let's start with this demo. If you are having any questions, please raise your hand or just interrupt me and we can discuss that point in more depth. Now, I want to show you the two examples that we are going to show today. We have a fast mover in which we think that the best approach is to use advanced supply planning. In this example, that is going to be repeated, but the parameters are going to be changed, is that we have two vendors, vendor one and two, very generic, and we have two locations, one in Abu Dhabi and one in Ruwais.\n\n What we are trying to showcase here is that there is a possibility of moving inventory from Abu Dhabi to Ruwais whenever we have some excess stock. Of course, we are considering that the lead time between these two locations is zero because they are very close. They are not going to take a lot to get from one site to the other. But from the vendor to the different locations, the lead time is going to be six months and the load size is going to be two.\n\n You can think on this load size like a constraint on the side of the vendor or maybe the transport list in which you cannot move quantities that are not in this multiple. It needs to be two and two, it cannot be three, it cannot be five, it needs to be a multiple of two. So, let's check this example. It's going to be for a generic valve, and the trigger here is going to be the demand. You need to remember that the forecast demand in this case is composed of a corrective part, the corrective demand forecast, and then also the requirement quantities are coming from the preventive plans.\n\n This is going to be the first example. The trigger is going to be the forecast for this particular one. The next one is going to be very similar. The main difference is that the trigger is going to be the reorder point. So, we are going to see the two things. Just to align the expectation from the beginning that we will see advanced supply planning and reorder point in the same demo. And the other one, the main difference is that this is a mid-mover.\n\n This is having a frequent consumption and the lead time is higher, it's nine months, right? Let's jump to the demo part where we have IPP. Let me pass forward. This is the one that we want to start with. The idea here is that we have these different tabs. The first ones are going to be our needs. The supply algorithms is trying to fulfill the demand, that in this case is the forecast, is trying to fulfill also the inventory targets that that in this case is the safety stock.\n\n So in this first two tab is just to analyze what are going to be the main inputs that we need to fulfill. In the next steps, we are going to see the stock balance. So we will see the stock projection. We are going to see what we have, what is coming, what is leaving our location, and what is the resulting stock location, sorry, projected stock. Then we will see stock transfers. We will see the depreciation.\n\n Which is proposal, these are the PRs, and finally, we can see a tab where we can see the demand fulfillment. Let's start by this one. What we were trying to convey the last session is that we have two sources of demand here. You will have a total demand that you see on this line, but this is coming from the sum of the corrective maintenance demand. Remember that the corrective is what expected and we are trying to come up with a forecast for that because we are not planning that.\n\n And then we have another line for prevent it. So this quantity that is coming here and you see with certain frequency is just the requirement of this material for preventing maintenance activities. Remember that this is a fast moving scenario and probably you want to have a recurrent preventive plan to just to prevent whatever. So if you see the part of the preemptive part is going to be very straightforward.\n\n Usually what we need here is that or you have the activities and then you have the bones, the materials that you're going to use and we explore the needs. So basically, very easily, in one way or another, we are not saying this is the only way that we are going to do it. In one way or another, we are going to translate your maintenance activities into material requirements. So that is going to happen here on IVP, or we are going to integrate the information already.\n\n That is not a big issue on the design, but we are going to translate this information into material requirement. For the corrective part is a little bit more complicated, let's say, because we have a forecast for that. And intrinsically, we know that the forecast is a very, it can be a very good estimation, but at the same time, you will have the reality that are going to be the reservations that we have.\n\n So what we want to do here is that given the case that we have the two, we have a forecast for the consumption and we have also the reservations, the reality, we need to conciliate this in a way. So whenever, for example, the reservations are higher than expected, we are going to do a forecast consumption, that is what we in the last week. In this forecast consumption, we try to conciliate the two words, right?\n\n The main idea is that as reservations are more certain than a forecast, then we need to respect as much as possible the reservation, because that is the real demand. The other one is an estimation. So you see that in the first period in November, you have five of material reservation, then your forecast forecast is going to be five. Okay, that's very simple. Where comes the interesting part? It's in the next period where we have demand.\n\n Here we are going to see what we call the forecast consumption. Basically what we are saying, you were expecting six failures between these months and five already happen right now. So they happen with anticipation. That means that in the future is less likely So, we need to try to consume the forecast because we were expecting to happen here, but they happened – sorry, we were expecting to happen here, but already happened here.\n\n Sorry, is there a question? Because it was difficult to understand the beginning was very low, the volume."},{"start_time":1732007772974,"end_time":1732007778973,"speaker":{"name":"Yaser Salem Bin Zubaa (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"I think, okay, go ahead.

All right, so what was explaining is that in this case we were expecting three, we consume in reality five, right? So, there are two missing that I need to consume from the next period. So, if I don't do that, you see that here I consume the additional two, three minus two, one. That is the forecast for the next period. If I don't do that, probably I'm going to overestimate the demand, right?\n\n Because I will say that in the next three periods the consumption is going to be plus five, plus three, eight, instead of six, right? So we are just trying to balance this forecast with the actuals, with the reservations, to have a better estimation of what is going to be the real demand signal. Let's remember that this is a fast moving scenario. We are proposing that in this case, the trigger of the replenishment is going to be the forecast.\n\n Why the forecast? It's because we think that there are going to be scenarios, maybe are not going to be the typical ones for you, but there are going to be scenarios in which the lead time is long enough, so we need to take decisions of replenishment with anticipation. As we don't have the actuals right now, we need to use a forecast to take that kind of decision. For the future, you see that the total demand is going to be equal to the forecast because as we don't have reservations, we are not going to incur in any consumption.\n\n If we have it, then the same can happen. If we get to have a reservation for six months in the future, then the same logic that you are seeing here can apply and we can use the reservation instead of the forecast and we can do the consumption to try to avoid double counting. Okay? So, that is the part of the demand planning. If you are having questions, just interrupt me. What is important to say is that – Just one comment.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732007910709,"end_time":1732007948503,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"It's a comment and also a question for the users.

Or to link that reservation with the end user budget. At the end of the year, the finances will come to the end user to consume that budget.

So this is an app called Analytics in IVP, which is in the Fiori and allows you, well, we can create any sort of reports. But in this case, what we are seeing here is first in blue bars, we have the actual consumption for corrective maintenance, okay?\n\n Then in the orange bars, we have the material reservations, okay? So we can see the is not the same that the actual consumption. You mentioned all the possible reasons of why we have this difference. And then we have this line showing the difference per percentage. And then, of course, IVP will take the actual consumption to generate the statistical forecast for corrective maintenance. As you can see, in reality, how this forecast will be generated is basically taking an average, the average consumption.\n\n First, the average periods for consumption, let's say you consume every six months or every year, it will take that for the history of the past three to five years. So let's say in the past for a specific material, let's say you consume every one time every year. So that's one thing. And then it will calculate how much you consume in average every time you consume. Let's say you consume one time per year, but each time you consume, you consume five units.\n\n So as you can see here, what the system is showing, well, we will go into more details, but it's consuming four units per year. But on the top of that, we have this, which is the forecast for CDM final, the users can collaborate, can create an input, of course, decreasing or increasing the amount, okay?

If we have the inputs to calculate the EOQ, it can be calculated and we will cover that in this session.

The demand, because of course we need to take into account PO's, PR's, lead time, so on and so forth. But at this point, what I'm showcasing now is just demand.\n\n It's that how much we will consume in the future. We're not thinking about how much we will buy. We're just thinking about consumption. Then, of course, we need to add more. And Hector will show us in full detail. We need to add more layers to the analysis. As I said, the EOQ, load size, the inventory policy, the lead time. But at this initial point, so the first step the process is to calculate how much is to estimate how much will I consume.\n\n Then based on that future consumption is that I'm going to buy. It can be the case that I'm required to buy maybe I have overstock in a different location so instead of buying I can bring the stock from a different add not plan to this plan to decrease cost. But we will get to that in just a few minutes. I want to finish this chart showing that you also have the ability here to drill down.

In this case, this is will show it will open the year right through months and we can see well we can see three bars right the consumption the reservation and the difference which was a hundred percent right because it was it was duplicated this is a very simplistic example but I'm trying to we're trying to explain here what the system different capabilities.\n\n And like this, we can build several different reports that can help you to enhance your analysis.

Once you click it, it takes you to a bigger snap.\n\n So your dashboard will have this facility as well? Drill down, yes, for sure. Yeah, okay, okay. Now I'm okay. Perfect."},{"start_time":1732009973993,"end_time":1732010368085,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Just as a suggestion, if you have any requirement, you can put it on the chat. We will gladly take it and then that way we can proceed with the demo and also take all the requirements because, you know, we are too many in the sessions and not everyone is going to talk at the same time. So if you can collect in any way by the chat for us, is going to be great. So if you have any reports ideas or things like that, please just put it on the chat and be sure that we are going to take it as part of the configuration later.\n\n All right, just to progress on this example, what we are saying here is this is a fast-mover example in which we are having many consumptions in a year. This is clearly a fast-mover for you and we have a lead time of six months in this case. So The reality is that if I wait for the consumption and I trigger the order, when I get the stock, I'm going to have many failures in the middle. That means that if I wait for the consumption event or for the reservation, probably I'm not going to be on time.\n\n That's why in these cases where we have very frequent demand and long lead times, we take the for forecast as a trigger because we need to take a decision with anticipation. That's the only reason. If you have short lead times, maybe this is not needed because as soon as you have the failures, you're there, you're going to get it on time. But if you have a long lead time and frequent consumption, the most likely scenario is that you need to rely on a forecast.\n\n That forecast can be generated by IVP or can be a manual forecast done by the user. But either way, I need to anticipate. That's the key word. That's why here on this example, we are using the total demand that is coming from an initial forecast that IDP is generating. Let's move to the more supply planning part. Here we have the stock balance. I tried to showcase in colors what is adding, in red what is subtracting, and then what we get.\n\n You will see that we start from the stock on hand, then we have some, that is going to be translated into PO on transport receipts. Transport receipt is whatever we are receiving on the facility. This is the total, right? So this can be, uh, open peel. It can be a maybe a plant PR that you that is still not a P O. But is, uh, is very certain that is to be going to be translated into appeal can be a proposal by the system, and so I will that this is summarizing many things.\n\n What is already real, like a PO, and what is a proposal that is done by the system. So, we will get very quickly. Then we have transport supply. This is a key information for you because this is what you don't have today. Transport supply means that I'm supplying from this plant or from this location to another internal location. So, you are transferring stock between locations and this key figure you from where to where you are moving stock, right?\n\n So if you have excess stock here, it's going to move it for the next one. Total demand is the real demand. It's the independent demand coming from the forecast. It's what we saw here on the first step. The forecast, the corrective maintenance, the planned maintenance, the actual reservations that you have. This is what you are seeing here, all right? So it's not a demand from another plant, but the demand amount from the same plant, from the machines, the assets that I have in this location.\n\n Then you have the safety stock because you always need to have safety stock. Safety stock is something that the system is calculating before as well for you. It's considering variability, it's considering the demand rate, it's considering the lead time, it's considering many parameters to get to this optimal calculation of the safety stock automatically done by the system. Then finally, you have the projected stock.\n\n The projected stock is going to be what I have plus what I'm receiving. In this case, you have nine, then minus what is leaving the facility, five, then you have four. That is the simple formula. Of course, if what is leaving is more than what we are receiving, it's going to be zero. In this case, you can see quickly an alert, it's saying, okay, we are below the safety stock. That should be the minimum stock possible.\n\n And then that's why we have an alert. And you are seeing this information in one facility and you are seeing in another facility. So let me showcase an example. Here, we have excess stock, all right? And in the end ways, we have the other scenario. We have less stock than we need. We are foreseeing that the demand here going to be high, but we are not prepared for that. So what the system is doing is moving stock from here.\n\n So in the perspective of this facility, it's going to be a transport supply, and in the perspective of this facility, it's going to be a transport receipt. So I'm receiving Ruwais from Abu Dhabi. I'm moving information from Abu Dhabi to Ruwais. That is the logic. You see that you receive it on the same period because, of course, the transport in the same country is going to be in the same period, we are not going to take more than that, and immediately trying to cover for certain portion of demand.\n\n In this case, the demand was higher than what it had, so the breakdown stock is zero. So we were not able to fulfill all that we wanted, but at least until a certain percentage we were able to do so. It's better for than nothing in this case, right? So that in the first six months, because this is the lead time, we are going to rely specifically on what is ongoing, like open POs, like the open PRs that need to be translated into POs.\n\n What is incoming, basically? Because in this first six periods, the system cannot propose because the system is reacting now. The lead time is six months, so the system proposal will come in the later periods. Let me show you here on the detail."},{"start_time":1732010368085,"end_time":1732010369596,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Let me – here."},{"start_time":1732010369596,"end_time":1732010629613,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"So, when we say that we have transport receipts, I told you that we have the sum of many things. So, one thing that is certain is that we will have open POs and STOs. For simplicity, I have it on the same line, but in the future can be two different lines. That is not an issue. But here is just These are the POs that are incoming from this vendor and from this another vendor, and we take it into consideration.\n\n As I say, in the first six months, there is not going to be any system proposal. You can see the proposed transfer receipts are 0, 0, 0. Then after May, you start receiving proposal because the system now can give proposal because now we have in our face or delete, and this is after the six months. So the system will propose you these quantities. You can see that they are multiple of two. This is basically the lot size.\n\n In this case, we are assuming that there is a constraint that whenever you buy from this supplier, you need to buy in quantities of two. You cannot buy in other quantities, but you can configure this as we need. This is just to showcase that we can put constraints on how we procure, but now necessarily is going to be reality. We need to put on the model what is happening right now. Also we are putting here open PRs just as an example because we think that it's a discussion that we need to have, is to understand what is the approval process of the PR and when we can consider the PR as certain to add to the stock.\n\n If the PRs can be overwritten or is in a late the state of approval, then we need to respect it. That is a discussion that we will need to have in some moment. But depending on that, we are going to consider the PR into the calculation or not, or we are just going to override the PR by the proposal of the system. So that is something that we need to understand. But the important message that we want to convey is that when we think on the transport receipt, it's going to be what is ongoing and also what is being proposed by the system, all right?\n\n What else to show? So then if we want to see what is only a proposed transport by the system, in this case, these are going to be STRs. Then we can have a tab in which you can see all that information. This STR should travel to S4HANA, of course, and then translate it into STOs. The same for the PRs. So you can see, for example, that for the the same material from different facilities. You are having proposals of the system of what should be the VR.\n\n And then you can consolidate it as well. You can see in this line that you have the consolidated quantity from all the facilities that are requesting the same material. All right? So in addition to that, finally, you can have a tab where you can see on detail. This can also be translated to a dashboard. Similar way, whatever we are showing here can be translated into a dashboard, the same way Bastian was showing just before.\n\n But in this case, we are showing what is the total demand of the facility, what was the total supply, and what was the fulfillment rate. So, were we able to fulfill what we were requesting, yes or no, and in which percentage. So, you can see that in the first six months, as we are relying only on what was planned with anticipation, we can face these cases that maybe we have excess, maybe we are in the other way around, we have stock outs, but after the six months, you start having 100% of accuracy because the proposals of the system are anticipating the needs, so we are able to get with the required quantity on the required period.\n\n That's the idea of this. Do you have any questions related to this that I'm showing right now?"},{"start_time":1732010637007,"end_time":1732010664554,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Or does it make sense?

So now we're going to look at some of the alerts that the system can generate. So when you go to any, so when you log into the system, this is the panel that you will have. We have seen this in previous session, but just for the users that haven't, it's for the first time looking at that IDP in the Excel. As we saw, this Excel add-in is connected to the Cloud and we are seeing this information directly from the Cloud.\n\n But here, we configure some alerts and we can see them directly here. If you go in here to the dashboard, it's showing us two alerts. If I click here, I can see we have two alerts. One is on demand alert and then we have three projected stock alerts or save this stock adder will be the right name for this one. So these ones are shown in the system by highlighting in red where the adder is happening.\n\n So let's review the data and you will have a deeper understanding of what is going on. So in this location, Ruwais and this material, we have the total demand, which as we have defined is composed by two components. Corrective maintenance, which is basically we're trying to predict when equipment will fail and we will need a spare part. And also for plus the preventive maintenance. So we're seeing that in January 2025, we need two units for this spare part.\n\n But then we have the total demand deliver, which is how much IBP is estimating will be able to fulfill out of the demand. So out of these two, IBP is telling us there's an other here highlighting in red. We only can fulfill one. Now we will find out why is that happening. So stock on hand is one. This is what we have. In our facilities, just one, okay? In safety stock, which was calculated based on historical data and the advanced algorithm by systems too.\n\n So this is the second alert that we have here, that our projected stock is below our safety stock. What is the meaning of that? It means that we are not prepared to any sudden demand, okay? Fails, we're not prepared to that because we only have one unit in stock. We didn't have reorder point here? In this point, we are using advanced supply planning, so we need to plan ahead."},{"start_time":1732012404964,"end_time":1732012405444,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1732012405444,"end_time":1732012412639,"speaker":{"name":"Arunkumar Viswanathan (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"Is it available for MRP type Z1 or PD?

So if we go to, well, the first incoming shipment we have is a PO. It's an overpull. Is ordered. If we go to the sheet of the POs, we will see that it's coming from Vendor 2. The Vendor 2 is sending, so we will receive in February 2025. And then one could wonder why don't we schedule this PO for for January so we can avoid this, so we can fulfill the 100% of demand.\n\n So if we go and take a look at the lead time, we can see that a lead time for one vendor is seven months and for the second vendor is three months. So because we're in November, it is not possible to get the material on time because the first time, I mean, the most possible treatment can be received in February, okay? So that is why the system is alerting us here. Look, you're uncovered for the first three months because the lead time, because your stock fall below your safety stock and the lead time is three months.\n\n So you will be able to get the material by February, okay? And again, coming back to this example here, to the dashboard, the system right away indicates you, look, there's an issue and take a look at that, okay? But once we finish, once we go through this initial period, there's no more alerts and the system is planning well ahead so it can avoid any stock out. And with that, we are generating the procurement plan that we have here, right?\n\n So again, considering the lead time, we have to place an order in November for two units, which we will receive in February. And in second place, we have an additional two units that we will receive in July. So for one is two, and for vendor two, two as well. So that means a split of 50-50. And why we are getting that split is because, as you can see here, we have a split of 50-50. This information of the quotas, we call it quotas, should come from your system.\n\n So in this case, we have an agreement with two vendors. And the agreement is that each one of these vendors supply 50% of the demand. Okay, so that is exactly what the system is doing, splitting the total demand by two, one for vendor one and one for vendor two, for vendor one and two for vendor two. Okay, and here we need in transport supply is when we need to place the order, in transport sheet to receipt is when we receive the order, okay?\n\n So, and the difference between these two is the lead time."},{"start_time":1732012660709,"end_time":1732012661578,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"OK."},{"start_time":1732012661578,"end_time":1732012665052,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Is there any doubt?"},{"start_time":1732012665052,"end_time":1732012665920,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yes."},{"start_time":1732012665920,"end_time":1732012678949,"speaker":{"name":"Navas Abdul Latheef (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"One question is the failure of the equipment from where you are getting this forecast."},{"start_time":1732012678949,"end_time":1732012680685,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Good question."},{"start_time":1732012680685,"end_time":1732012822824,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Let's go here. So this forecast is generated through mainly from one source, which is the actual usage consumption of material for corrected maintenance. So, based on the history of each equipment, and so basically when an equipment fails, you generate a corrected maintenance order, and that order has certain materials. We use that history to generate the forecast, okay? But if It's not by using an average or something like that.\n\n It's done by using a specific algorithm that address this kind of phenomenon. What is that? It's very low consumption and with space, with a lot of zero consumptions across time. So it's like you have one consumption every one year or two consumptions every six months. That kind of consumptions are modeled by the algorithms that we're using here. So here, following this example, well, I have it here in years.\n\n So we have this part, and let's say this is a spare part. Let's say it's a part of an equipment. This is the consumption. As we can see, it's one unit in 2020. 4 units in 2021, 2 units in 2022, so on and so forth. So this is going to be the main input to generate the forecast. And then we have the forecast here, which is 4, and then in 2028 is 2. So if we review this again, we can go here to IVP and change the view to months.\n\n So we have the time settings. I'm going to change the view to month from, let's say, let's start from 2021, beginning of 2028 till the end of 2026.

And as we can see, this This forecast was generated using that history. We can see here the forecast in this bar here, light blue.\n\n So the system calculates two things. Calculates the average time between consumptions, let's say you on average, of course, on average, you consume every six months, and then it calculates the demand quantity, so how much you consume every time you consume. I don't know if that makes sense. Okay, you consume, let's say, on average, every six months, and each time you consume every six months, you consume, in this case, two units.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732012903772,"end_time":1732012904526,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1732012904526,"end_time":1732012982944,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"But just to recall a concept, this is just for corrected maintenance. The preventive maintenance is going through a different track, and at the end, the total demand is a combination of the corrected maintenance, when the equipment will fail or when the equipment will need a new spare part, plus the preventive maintenance. So, of course, if you increase the preventive maintenance, it is very likely that you will decrease the corrective maintenance, but you are the experts on that.\n\n You need to find a balance, right? You cannot be doing preventive activities. So, let's time.

It's a minimum quantity in order to face uncertainty because if you face the, sorry, if you replenish based on a forecast, you know that the forecast is not going to be 100% accurate.\n\n It then you need to have just in case a buffer stock that is going to be a safety stock calculated by the system to avoid any stock out with certain probability.

Yeah, so yeah, there is this basic difference between understanding of reorder point and advanced applied learning. So probably we'll get to see more about this when we look at your data in subsequent sessions. But one thing for this, we will not be able to compare the reorder point planning in S4 HANA and then the on-demand PD planning in Hesperana as one-to-one with reorder planning and advanced supply planning.\n\n But for sure, with more data and in future sessions, we'll be able to see the difference and understand how IVP works. Let me share my screen and we can go through the open points. This is the list of open points. So we've had three sessions on maintenance, and we've captured all these open points. So today, we'll go through all these open points to close on this supply planning discussion of maintenance.\n\n So let me go through this point one by one. So essentially, not all the materials go through ROP or supply planning. We need help from AdNoc to essentially identify how to prioritize the materials which will go through reorder point planning or supply planning. So basically we have shared a segmentation matrix. The segmentation matrix identifies how we can prioritize whether the material should be point on advanced supply planning or reorder point planning and based upon this metric system will determine which planning algorithm to be used.\n\n So critically and the risk factor which is being identified for a material master will help us determine. So we've shared this segmentation metrics with the team and we can go back and work with the team to make sure that we are able to close on this point and close this metric so that once the metric is closed, system will be able to determine whether it is reorder point or supply And then we can test the outcome from the system in the subsequent phases.\n\n Then next is the aggregation and disaggregation, like the hierarchy in which we have to define. So we discussed this, that we need to define the hierarchy. So we have considered this as an input, that the hierarchy is the MRTL group, MRP controller, plant, and then the group company. And we can use this as an input. So is this correct understanding of hierarchy that you have the MRP controller, the MRTL group, the plant, and then the group company?\n\n You made this you mean this emboss right yeah so basically so when you say hierarchy like what is the lowest level so you have a lowest level of how you want to group the data together or sum the data together so you have material group you have a material as the lowest material group material material group then you have mrp controller at the next level then you have plant at an mrp level and then is this for the"},{"start_time":1732013637206,"end_time":1732013673185,"speaker":{"name":"Arunkumar Viswanathan (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"pr aggregation in general aggregation of data how you want to look at data in S4 analyzer whatever now the currently followed for the MRP PR the same can be adopted that's what the manufacturer also currently whatever there is the algorithm defined for the MRP logic now the same can be adopted you are saying PR grouping logic can be adopted yes Yes, there are BR consolidation rules and logic."},{"start_time":1732013673185,"end_time":1732013688205,"speaker":{"name":"Yaser Salem Bin Zubaa (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"Yeah, that we have done for the last three years and we have streamlined it.

I have to jump to the other status for. So we have these two points coming from the previous discussion where we had this input that if the supply proposal is less than MOQ, minimum order value, then replenish. So I will not review this point. Rahul, you're not sharing. Can you share your screen? Oh, sorry. I thought I'm sharing. Thanks. Thank you. So yeah. So we've discussed the first two points.\n\n Now the next two points are from the previous meeting only where if you remember there was If one of the material goes below ROP, then all the materials of the vendor should be filled to the max. Or if the total quantity of order value is less than the agreement value, then we need to make sure that all the materials. We need this clarification on the strategic decision here. You have something to add, Sebastian, here?\n\n OK. So yeah, so this is something we need inputs this is an open point but then I will share this separately with the team and we can get this confirmation whether it's really requirement or do you want us to consider this as part of supply planning but this is an open point. We also discussed that the lead time for pure approval is one week if there is a PO and if there is agreement if there is no agreement and time for PR to POS 10 week.\n\n And then we discussed that the new SLA is being drafted, and this can be used for input for defined lead time. So this is something which we also discussed today, that external and internal lead time. So internal lead time to be defined as for Anna. We will align this with the technical team. We discussed that there needs to be a separate discussion for LNS, so that if there are any points specific to LNS, those can be incorporated.\n\n So we have a follow-up action. We have action to have follow-up meeting with LNS. We also discussed that the manual material reservation is used for returns. So if there is a return of any spare excess consumption, then that return should also be considered. So we have noted this point and we will work with the technical team to make sure that the excess return is considered as part of the planning.\n\n We also discussed that in some cases, MAP, moving average price is not maintained correctly. Will need to use either last procurement time price as input for the cost in IPP. So we need this confirmation on which price to be used. We can use the price, either last procurement price or moving average price. But then we need this confirmation as which price to be used for valuation of inventory. We also discussed that non-moving or slow-moving are defined on on-demand, so this has to be part of the risk segmentation so in the risk segmentation we have defined that what is critical what is fast moving what is slow moving so based upon the category whether it is non-moving or slow moving or it is high risk or low risk we can use this input for the risk segmentation.\n\n Metal it was discussed that BC metal to be used so it's already part of risk segmentation so this segmentation considers this input that if it's a BC metal it gets highest priority in terms of risk we don't negotiate. In the previous discussion ESG was one of the point raised so we said that we will evaluate and get back to you on what is the possible options from ESG. We also discussed about the repairable material we need identification of repairable material so that we can we can raise an alert saying that if the repairable material is getting planned for procurement then user the inventory planner can check with the end user.\n\n So we've taken this part of the requirement and we will make sure that as part of technical mapping we know this repairable field is available and we are able to set up this alert. In today's call we discussed about these three points on high level. We need that PR to be linked with budget and how this can give end-to-end visibility. We will point and we'll review how this can be done. Then ad-hoc to share so we also discussed that ad-hoc to share sample reports we've shown the reports but if you can share sample reports it's not immediately required but if you can share sample reports it will help us in the designing the initial few reports and then from there we can start reviewing it.\n\n We this is one critical point what we discuss is the ability to raise PR even if vendor is not finalized even if the historical procurement has a vendor in system if the material is not business continue today which means it will go through trending process again and a new vendor may get identified to trigger the procurement which means from a supply planning this is a critical input and we need to we have taken this as an input and we will allow we'll see how this can be learned maybe so this is what yeah yes this was some of the points anything else which we are and Raghul do you have any inbuilt report in IBP it's already existing maybe you can show that it will be very helpful yeah yeah so I'm taking an additional point project team team to demonstrate standard reports what because it straight yeah so I've taken this input anything else anything else any other input which we've discussed which is not captured as part of this discussion.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732014372052,"end_time":1732014379430,"speaker":{"name":"Yaser Salem Bin Zubaa (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"Thank you.

Yeah. They're still under study. We will try to finalize that case. We're trying to figure out, because some GCs, they utilize the same material number several times. Yeah. So they don't... Another different material number because of the different things. They can use the same material number. They can specify in the UM, unit of measurement. They can specify how much the length that they want of this material request.\n\n For those companies who use that, we try to consider how we can create some sort of criteria, is it by plant or is it by GC, so the length will not be, so these materials will not be aggregated in PR. So currently we are still studying this matter. As soon as we finish, we finalize the whole segments that you want for this. Inshallah we will share it with you, Mohamed.
