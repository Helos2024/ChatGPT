Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Hi Nikita. Hi. Hi Misha. Hi Kal.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Bye guys. Bye Heidi. Bye Heidi. You Who are the main people that you're expecting on this call, so I can start chasing if needed? We were just at the same meeting with Raul, Hector and Sebastian, so I think the guys will join shortly.

Patel, Rahul:
Raul is here.

Bastian Osorio:
Hi, Raul.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello. Do we have... No.

Patel, Rahul:
I think with Raul, we can start.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Raul, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And Rocio is also with us from GoSCM. Hi, Rocio. Hi, how are you?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, sure, let's start and maybe Edgar and Bastian are going to show it soon. But let's start with continuing reviewing the roles from the last session. Yeah, so just to remind, last session we got stuck with the definition of MRO demand-related roles, right? So I suggest that we I'll go to the next stage and start filling in the, just a second, I was going to, just a second, I'll refreeze the cells here.

 Just a second, I think it's down here. And I wanted to place it here. Freeze, unfreeze, unfreeze. I think it's gonna work right. Yeah cool so let's go let's go and try to fill in like I would I would I think I would suggest to go um Process variant by process variant. Yeah, let's go through demand planning first. Let's look at it. Even like in demand planning, I will take an MRO, just an MRO, right?

 And then we will concentrate on a few roles, for example, and these three will kind of refine the role description, as well as we'll have a really manageable scope to look at, right? Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
And I feel demand planning is the most complicated in terms of roles and responsibilities. If you're done through demand planning, then inventory and supply planning are pretty straightforward, considering only inventory management team is part of those roles. Exactly. So I think, yeah, let's start with demand. Eat that frog first, which is most difficult, and then we'll move to supply and inventory.



Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, let's look at MRO first, right? Yeah, Raul, just general question in the beginning. How do you think we should go AGC by AGC in describing these few parameters for the role? Because I think it's not universal for all, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Well, probably frequency will be the So at this point of time, we have not, in the entire process, or any of the document, differentiated between AGCs. So whatever we have discussed and documented is same across all the AGCs which are applicable for the given process.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Uh-huh.

Patel, Rahul:
Which means that whatever we discuss, we don't need to discuss at AGC level, because we've never discussed at AGC level with AdBlock as well.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah. Then let's try to describe these three columns for these three roles, yeah? So how, what exactly are these guys doing? Like they come to the work, they sit down on the nice chair, what they are doing in front of their laptop when working with the IBP solution and with the new process? Who does it start with? It starts with the demand request I guess, right? The guy who will actually look at his specific site or plant or plant section as you mentioned, right?

 And this guy would and uh certain data right so can you try to this to describe it in simple words for each of the three roles so basically demand requester will basically check the material are part of his rules

Patel, Rahul:
and responsibility, and verify whether demand needs to be changed. So and verify demand. So rather than needs to be changed, verify demand is OK. If it is not OK, verify demand is correct. Or if it is. What do you mean demand is correct?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Demand forecast is correct.

Patel, Rahul:
So demand forecast, you can say demand forecast. Hector is also here on the call. So Hector, I'm just putting some simple words for what demand requester is supposed to do.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And this is what we're having. So our goal, guys, just for you to understand the ultimate is to go through each of these roles and first describe what they do, how frequently they do it, which kind of operations they, sorry, which number of operations they execute, and then also describe how, like where in the organization this role will be located and how many people. For example, if we have a few plant sections done is it going to be by plant section for this role for example right so what are the drivers to look to place this role so to locate these roles so and we start with just describing what exactly this guy is going to be doing regardless of the fancy system words right just in this very simple like business practice word and we say that demand requester is going to check materials and verify demand forecast if it's okay or it needs to be changed.

 And that is done how often? Monthly or quarterly?

Hector Palacios:
For me what this guy, the MRO requester is going to do and it's going to be a role more on the side of chemicals for me. This is MRO.

Patel, Rahul:
So we are talking first MRO then we'll go into chemicals.

Hector Palacios:
I'm not really sure what they these guys are going to go on MRO, Rahul, because I think that most of MRO is going to be reordered point-based planning. So I'm not really sure on this one. I think that we need to park it a little bit. Let me discuss with Bastian because we have that discussion pending. But it's our feeling that on an MRO is little or nothing what we are going to do related to forecast planning.



Patel, Rahul:
Okay, so because in Tomorrow we have corrective, preventive, and turnaround. So you are saying preventive and turnaround would be based upon the plans. So there is no user intervention. For corrective as well, you are saying there will be a lot of reorder point planning?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Order based plan.

Hector Palacios:
Yes. Because on the assessment that the data team did, the fast movers are like 1% of the data. 1%. So, I think that basing a whole strategy just based on a tiny part of the... It doesn't make sense. So, I want to check, I'm not discarding it, but certainly it's going to be reduced. Whenever I discuss this with Murugan or when the guys were like thinking, no, no, the fork doesn't make sense, I told them that this is for fast movers and they, okay, now it makes sense.

 Sack with Nabil, the maintenance guy, he was also very confused and I told him, no, this is for a fast mover and then it makes sense to do a nice work. But for mid-movers, slow movers and whatever it is, it doesn't make sense to plant on forecast. I think that this is going to be completely reduced. But the idea that we have so far is that if we do this role, basically it's going to be a guy that is going to be consolidating the demand forecast from the many business unit, AGC, sorry.

 Ah, like one role centrally.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, yeah, it's going to centralize.

Hector Palacios:
That's why now I'm just thinking for MRO doesn't make sense this role, because either way, the maintenance guys, they are not going to provide us any forecast, right? They don't work like that. They won't do it.

Patel, Rahul:
So because row number 12 is something we said is the demand planner which is more of an IGC level or centralized tool right? Yeah this is the one. So Hector what you're seeing is you are still having this discussion internally with Bastion and then based on the data you looked into the system you feel this will role may not be applicable to a model process. And by when your evaluation would be complete so that we can take this.



Hector Palacios:
I mean, if the forecast doesn't make sense at all, then the demand planner and the demand request or whatever is on demand side will lose weight.

Hector Palacios:
It's not a great idea, by the way, trying to have demand planners from the maintenance team. It sounds really complicated.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
And it's an important input, Hector. And then if this is something you feel, based on looking at the data and the tool, then we need to go back to AdNoc and tell them, we need to make sure that we decide on these steps. Because it's important for us, because we ourselves are pushing for this change management roles and responsibilities from maintenance. And I have input from Khalid on now the maintenance single point of contact for different agencies, which are specific to maintenance.

 And we are supposed to discuss this process with them. And if you feel, based upon the data way you have understood it, if you feel that this is something which may not be applicable, then I think it's better to conclude on this as soon as possible, so that we can get back to AdNoc with our recommendation. I will put a task on our side to do this.

Hector Palacios:
Can we put on yellow these demand rules on MRO? In the meantime, let's spark it, and then we can retake a discussion on them.

Patel, Rahul:
Let's leave it as an open point. So the entire demand MRO, including demand requester, demand manager, and demand planner, all three roles, what Bhaskar is saying is on hold. Correct, Bhaskar?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
If we don't use that.

Patel, Rahul:
Now just for your, Hector, in our BPD, we have shown this as a process based upon the workshop discussion. And if we feel that this may not be applicable, then we also need to eventually revise the process to make it more system-based task and not user-based.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So we're parking all of the MRO-related roles demand planning right so we're saying at this point of time we don't even consider human participation in it right so we're saying it's going to be fully automated next to 100 automated

Hector Palacios:
yeah yeah the point is that the whole plan um using a forecast is trying to anticipate in these cases we think that we need to anticipate that we need to wait that this to happen so that means we can base our supply plan inventory policy based on consumption the real consumption and we don't need a plan if we don't need a plan then we don't need a demand plan and we don't need a demand request so we don't need it demand manager you know so that's something that I want to check with Bastian first then we can come back to you but even just for for us to be aligned even if we do have this role, the representation is going to be very reduced.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We are thinking a very tiny portion of the materials.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Then currently it's all NA and we can basically park the whole MRO section on hold, right? Yeah, for the user identification. So basically when the process will continue in inventory management and supply planning part, as well as the role will be for the process champion, right? To make sure that this part of the process works well. Something like that, right? Is that correct or not?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Karl, could you please take these notes as we go so that we keep it for our further discussions with business? Okay, cool.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So we go to the next one, yeah?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Which one do you want to pick? You want to pick chemicals or we can go in order of these rows in here? Like we can touch drilling.

Patel, Rahul:
I think let's go to chemicals because then drilling becomes elastic.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, let's touch chemicals and I think, Raul, you already started describing this planar rule, right? In this way, check materials and verify demand forecast if it's okay and needs to be changed. Is that correct or not?

Patel, Rahul:
No problem, in chemicals that will change because we have two different kinds of chemical processes. One is reorder point-based and second is demand-based or forecast-based.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Demand-forecast-based.

Patel, Rahul:
So when it is reorder type-based, then Hector, if it is reorder type planning, then the role of the planner is reduced, right? Yeah. Similar to what you're saying for MRO.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
The role of planner is reduced similar to MRO. OK, fine.

Patel, Rahul:
And then second is if it is a forecast-based.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yep.

Patel, Rahul:
Then he he provides the forecast and provide forecast input. He provides the forecast. Reviews the forecast, provides the forecast and then. Yes, I'm here, sorry.

Hector Palacios:
I'm just thinking that maybe the whole idea of the that you were thinking about it. And the last section applies very well here on chemicals.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Am I correct?

Hector Palacios:
Because for MRO, I was discussing with you guys, for MRO, we don't even know if we are going to have a forecast at all. But for chemicals, we are certain. So the role of the demand planner consolidating from the many AGCs I think that applies here.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
May I ask a few questions again? For this role, if you say we have two types, reorder and demand forecast based, right? How do we decide which chemical would be in which of these groups?

Hector Palacios:
We have some recommendations based on lead time, based on consumption frequency and so on, which means that for most of the chemicals are like candidates for forecast planning, because the consumption is very frequent, so you need to anticipate. But it seems that there are some AGCs that are planning some way, so probably they will want to stay that way. So basically, we will decide by AGC in this case that like 98% of the cases.



Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
It would be different by different AGCs, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Another question, how much of volume of inventory volumes will be going through and this one. Reorder, is it going to be the most of the chemicals or the… No, we haven't had access to that level of information yet.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, okay, okay.

Patel, Rahul:
But if you split it by AGC level, it is immaterial, because then if it is AGC level, then you will have someone at AGC level to look at the forecast, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
OK.

Patel, Rahul:
So Bastian, correct me if I'm wrong here, that the role of when it is forecast-based is to basically provide and update and review the forecast.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And then the second thing is essentially looking at the alerts.

Bastian Osorio:
Are they?

Patel, Rahul:
Alerts, looking at different alerts.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Yes, like levels, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Demand planner may not be responsible for levels, but then forecast accuracy related alerts, because essentially his role is to review the forecast, right? So if there are reports and alerts related to forecast accuracy, then probably he will review those so that he can use those alerts as an to make sure the forecast is further corrected.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So he provides and reviews forecast in which way? Is he seeing something already pre-populated by the system or it's completely manually input into the system for each of the number of inventory positions?

Patel, Rahul:
System recommends. System recommends.

Hector Palacios:
They check that we can have some alerts, maybe comparing late changes versus the last cycle, and so on, just to bring into attention the big changes or things that they need to look into. And they can adjust over if they need to. So basically, review, that review goes here, checking alerts, and then adjust the exercise.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
exceptions.

Hector Palacios:
But they need to start from a proposal, they cannot just put a number and overwrite whatever the system is proposing.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, okay, cool. Is that all we want to mention for the type of activities for this role? Or is there anything else?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, for the reasons.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, for the point one, we can still mention the alerts and reports as one of the activities, even if it is a reorder point. Correct, Bastian. Do you think, will there be any alert or review for reorder point? Or everything will happen in inventory and supply planning? Will we have any alerts with respect to reorder point planning?

Hector Palacios:
But that is on the side of inventory controllers.

Patel, Rahul:
Nothing on the demand?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
No, I don't think so.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Patel, Rahul:
So we are saying, Literally no input from the demand planner for reorder point, which means if it is reorder point similar to MRO, there is no input required. No, no.

Hector Palacios:
I think that the reorder point is completely out of demand scope. It's on the inventory site. If they are not doing it that way, we can hear them. We can adjust maybe. But supposedly that is on the inventory module, that is inventory controllers.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, then that's good.

Patel, Rahul:
Because maybe they are doing it on the operation side.

Hector Palacios:
Wouldn't sound crazy to that that is the case. If they said that they were planning, we are the point planning, then probably they are managing that as well. We need to, that's one of the discussions we have with them? With the inventory guys? Yeah, who is doing that? The inventory guys or the operation teams? Who is managing the real deployment?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's the inventory guys.

Hector Palacios:
It's inventory guys?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Then yes, only with them.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, okay. Then I think that's the rule for planner and the manager essentially approves the demand and again looks at the alerts. And reports. And then managers will be again limited to the second forecast based because if it is reorder point then there is no work for demand planner then there is no work for demand manager as well.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Is it also an AGC-level role like Plenum?

Patel, Rahul:
That's something we need to check, that at what level they want to have approval. We'll need input from AdNoc is that, from a demand perspective, who approves demand? Like someone at AGC level will review it, or it will be multi-level saying that If the demand is at plant level, then someone approves at plant. And then if someone has approved at plant, then at AGC level someone. So multi-level or whether it will it be a multi-level approval.

 Because if I'm like a senior manager or a vice president, then I have, I'm responsible for let's say 10 AGCs. Then I can have a operations manager at AGC level who approves for AGC and then I don't know. So we need to we need to understand in detail on how the roles and responsibilities are there in AdNoc for from an approval perspective. They did mention they wanted to have multi-level approval, which means someone responsible for a respective section approves that or AGC may have multiple and someone responsible for a specific plant approves their plant, then it gets collated at AGC level and someone at AGC level approves based upon the approval at plant level.

 Also, there will be a work for, like, the – one of the things is alerts. The manager will also look at the alerts and then based upon the alerts, provide approval. So reports and alerts will be part of manager's rule as well.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, that is something to clarify with the business.

Patel, Rahul:
You want to mention the reports and alerts as part of manager or you want to like keep it only part of the...

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yes.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Thank you. OK, now we've covered both roles.

Patel, Rahul:
Hector, are you online here? Manager's role?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hector, Sebastian? Let me check.

Bastian Osorio:
you Bye.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
is can you hear me yes yes for me it's fine sounds good now for this tool let's uh quickly fill in frequency and number frequency is monthly monthly for both yeah obviously because these guys will do their work after

Bastian Osorio:
these guys yeah but for for the inventory calculation I mean the inventory responsible inventory controller inventory planner the frequency I think it should be quarterly but it's these guys right we'll have a look at them later yeah yeah OK,

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
cool.

Patel, Rahul:
What do you mean by number of operations here?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
For example, they look at the alerts. How many alerts will be there, right? How many inventory? In-entry, what individual in-entry items, or are these groups of finishes? Like how many lines? So how many hours would this guy need to spend?

Bastian Osorio:
It depends on how many materials they need to check, they need to review. And I don't even know one of how many, like one demo planner, for example, of how many materials he will be responsible. Will he responsible for only one AGC or multiple AGC? That is something that I don't know. So for me, it's not possible to say.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. OK.

Hector Palacios:
I was talking a lot on mute. I just realized like two minutes So, yes, in line with Basti, we have no way to understand that yet. I also was mentioning that on the frequency probably for some specific materials they want to do it bi-weekly or for nightly, they call it, every two weeks. Do you remember, Basti, that for chemical supplies as well?

Bastian Osorio:
Because I know that for MRO they were saying something like that I'm not sure but I guess so because I guess for these materials that every two weeks they feel the tank or something like that I'm not sure what it was on a weekly or monthly basis but it could be the case that is weekly like I wouldn't be surprised so then I guess the same frequency would apply for the if they need to.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah. I'm sorry, that's just a second. Same, yeah? And same as here, right? It depends on how many, what the structure of materials would be, how many of materials will be there.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
The alerts is something that we can control so we can adjust to have less more alerts so in order not to overwhelm but depends on the number of materials that I think that there are many. So for every EC for sure they are going to be different so but we don't have access to that information.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Now let's move on to the next question and the next question is how many of them would we need based on the specific probably specific group company structure yeah so it's going to be group companies specific. Is it or not all. We believe. Can you hear me.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
Now I can. So we believe because I think this operation managers is analog analog to the demand demand planner right operation planner. So our recommendation is that one demand planner multiples AGC. This guy, this role should be part of the chair services. Like he is the one questioning the demand coming from the requester at AGC level. But in that regard is not at AGC level, but on on a more centralized part of the organization.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
organization.

Bastian Osorio:
Because if the requester and the demand planner are in the same agency, I feel the role is redundant.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which one?

Bastian Osorio:
No, no, if this if this role. One per AC, then for me the role doesn't have too much sense. It will be redundant because you have the requester, you will have in that case the requester and the demand planner basically doing a very similar job.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
But we don't have requesters here. For chemicals, or do we?

Bastian Osorio:
I believe we should have, Hector.

Hector Palacios:
OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
For chemicals, yes.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So it will be called chemicals demand requester? Yes. And that's going to be a new one, which is not there in BPD, right? Yeah. I have a quick question here, Hector and Bastian.

Patel, Rahul:
How Chemical Demand Requestor is different than Operations Planner?

Bastian Osorio:
So for me, and sorry if I missed the first part of the meeting, the Requester is basically the one doing the analogy with MRO is the engineer, which needs to just do their job and put how much chemicals they need. They're not focusing on the medium or long-term planning horizon, whereas the The right name is Chemicals Demand Planner. He's focusing on multiple AGCs and medium and long-term demand planning.

 But that's the main difference. This person, this role, is managing multiple AGCs and doing the forecast and looking at the consumption on a longer time horizon, whereas the requester is just like an engineer doing his job, his daily job.

Patel, Rahul:
OK. Because this is not something we are discussing as part of our 2B workshop. So if we are going to recommend this, then we need to have this conversation. Probably after we demonstrate them how other things are there, probably we need to take up this conversation. And I don't even know if we'll be able to conclude on this, that this is how we want to do this. But probably based upon GoSMP team's recommendation, we can take their suggestion, discuss with them.

 And if they are aligning, then we can take this process change.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So, Raul, currently we have been suggesting two roles for chemicals, right? One was planner and one was manager.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And requester is the third one, is the new one, right? We never discussed it? We never discussed it.

Patel, Rahul:
so it was never part of our demonstration or even the workshops what we discussed we never had this role defined.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Is it the matter of substance or is the matter of the language? Maybe what guys are mentioning here as demand request and maybe you thought of it as demand plan or operations planner or not? Or it's completely differencing.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, that's what I'm understanding from what Hector or Bastian is recommending, is that the requester role is more tactical, which means he takes care of his respective area or plant section the way he was mentioning for MRO. Similar, he is envisaging someone who is looking at their specific materials for the month or for the week or for the current shorter period and making sure that his day-to-day requirement or week-to-week or month-to-month requirement is taken care of Whereas what I understand from what Hector is suggesting is that the planner is more of a strategic who looks at longer-term horizon, but then when he looks at longer-term horizon, he looks at multiple agencies at once.

 So he's not worried about specific planned sections or plans. So you have requesters who are working on limited time horizon at specific plant or plant section level. And based upon their input, the planner basically looks at on a longer horizon of how things should be for maybe IGC or group of AGCs.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I don't know.

Patel, Rahul:
So that's what I understood from what Hector and Bastian were suggesting. If I'm wrong here, Hector or Bastian.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, there are some specific tasks, Bastian, correct me if I'm wrong, but or I'm not thinking the same as you, but there are some specific tasks on the system that if we take it to the HTC layer, I think that is not going to make sense, like generating the forecast for all of them at the first point. So if he can be the one that is going to do that for them, they can review it, they can adjust it, and so on, but all the system activities or configuration that they need to make sure that they are working, we need to centralize that in one person.

 And that person also will be the responsible for the consolidation of this forecast on all the AGCs because the problem, someone will need to make sure that this is happening, right? At the end, we have very AGC level demand side activities and then we have a very consolidated high-level inventory activities. So if it's not going to be the demand planner, it's going to be the inventory controller for sure.

 So if we don't have any demand request or the inventory controller, we'll need to make sure that everyone is given their forecast. Especially if we have the same materials across different AGCs, we need to consolidate. So who's going to be Who is going to push these guys to have the forecast ready by when we need it?

Bastian Osorio:
The thing is that, and it's something that Nabil told us, we cannot expect an engineer who is doing the maintenance, who is fixing stuff, is leading teams like other engineers, technician teams, to make, to run the forecast, to take a look at it. It's not the right person for the role. He should be focusing, his role is on the operation. And of course you need to estimate how much materials he will consume, whether it's MRO or it's chemicals, but on the short term basis, right?

 In the next month or the next three months. This person, he's not a data expert. He's just focusing on the operation or keeping the operation running. So I think we cannot, it won't be a good advice to recommend this person to start looking at the forecast on the median and long-term. That's why we are saying this person should be a centralized role looking at the data multiple AGCs. Of course, as you say, Hector, the forecast will be run at AGC level, at material level.

 So it's a very low level. But then the consolidation will be it will be through multiple agencies. Do we have the common understanding of this role of the demand planner, which here you're calling and I understand operation planner, and the requester as well. For me, the requester is the engineer or the multiple engineers working per AGC.

Hector Palacios:
So I see, if you think on a common SNOP process, you have a demand planner and you have different departments, right? So for us, the demand requestor, here's the demand planner. The other departments are the AGCs. Because the demand planner is the one that knows the system, that creates the orchestrate that this is working. The other guys are just going to bring input. They are going to review, adjust, and swarm, but no more than that.

 They are not going to be savvy on the system. They are not going to be great users. They are just contributing, right? But the demand requestor, for me, that is the real demand planner. Demand requestor is the one that is going to make sure that everything is happening on the system.

Bastian Osorio:
But that role for MRO, at least, Hector, we call demand planner.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which one? The requester?

Bastian Osorio:
No, the requester for us, for MRO, the requester is the engineer. It's just requesting, I need two pieces of this material for next month. I need three pieces, that's it.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking on the other way around. Yeah, OK. So you're re-corrected that demand planner is the main one. Yeah, that's right. I was misaligned.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, the only thing is that, guys, we have shared the documents. We have approved demand BPD. Now, if you want to take this change back to, say, right now, we still want to sound professional. And make sure that we don't get into a conversation where AdNoc gets back to us saying that, guys, you've shared us the process before. This is what you understood from our discussion. This is what you proposed, and we've agreed to your process.

 Now you yourself are changing your own process. So probably we may need to make sure that this communication happens in a subtle way so that AdNoc agrees to this if we want to have this discussed. That's the risk of carrying this change later in the intro discussion.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So- Yes, yes.

Patel, Rahul:
May I ask a simple question?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Excuse me, guys, may I ask a simple question? Would the process work without these guys at the lower level of AGC or even section of a plant and specific materials they need? Would the process work without it?

Hector Palacios:
No, we need someone that understands our data and reviews it. They are doing it that way today. The demand requesters today, exist. They are the ones created there.

Patel, Rahul:
At least for the chemicals one we know they exist not for MRO but for the chemicals one we know they exist and they are defining the demand so we know. Now the only difference here is that if we are able if we are splitting this role between more tactical and strategic then we should clearly highlight why we are requesting this what we've understood, what is the difference in our understanding before versus after, and how this will help AdNoc on IVP side.

 So we should be able to clearly highlight this so that, because... Raul, may I interrupt you?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
May I interrupt you for a second? Can we go a more elegant way of doing the same? Can we say, okay guys, we put into our BPDs, the demand planner, But we assume there will be like level one and level two at the plant level, let's say, and consolidated level demand planner. Can we go that way, do you think? Without changing anything. But we'll have a very specific discussion with the business, regardless of what we put into BPD.

 Just as an idea.

Patel, Rahul:
I agree with your suggestion. The only thing is, before we go with this change to AdNod, we should have some more clarity on how the org structure is going to be. Like, at what level this request is to the state. We don't know yet. We know demand requesters are there, but we don't know at what level these demand requesters are working. Are they working at plant level? Are they working at plant section level?

 Are they working at AGC level? Unless we have that clarity, we should not go and ask for this change. Because if we request this change without that clarity, then we may get into risk of changing the design for the third time when we know actual facts, what's happening on the ground. So while I'm aligning to the proposal which Hector and Bastian are having, agreeing to maybe splitting this role into, say, make it Demand Planner 1 or 2, but then whatever proposal we are suggesting should depend upon the fact that at what level this is happening today.

 So that if once we have this input, then we can go back and say that, OK, this is how it should happen. And we can then put up our method that based upon the understanding of the facts, what you have today, this is how we want you to do.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And it will sound more convincing as well to AdNod then. Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
All right.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
okay let's move on yeah and for these guys okay if for example if this this role is in place is it going to be the same monthly or bi-weekly for some of materials in terms of frequency of operations monthly

Patel, Rahul:
weekly weekly as well because uh the business continuity matters would be at weekly so we have all three frequencies but but I don't think so. Yeah, weekly there is a review often. But Hector and Bastián, the weekly or bi-weekly is only for supply planning, right? Not for demand? Do you think weekly, monthly, bi-weekly or weekly is also for demand? Yeah, you're right, you're right.

Hector Palacios:
It was more on the supply side indeed, not on demand. Let's put it monthly then.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Monthly, okay.

Hector Palacios:
You can copy that for the supply roles, because there we are going to use this version. But that is the inventory controller role.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, but those are the centralized roles, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah. For supply. Yeah, those are the centralized roles for supply, yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Then I just delete it from here, then I keep it monthly, right? For all of them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. I'm back, sorry. So, okay, coming back, let's move on for chemicals, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So we spoke about demand planner and you suggested to have this as a centralized role at the shared service level, right? Then for the manager, I guess it's the person next to this person in the shared service who just approves whatever is suggested by the planner, right? So it's also a centralized role at the shared service level. Is that correct?

Bastian Osorio:
Yes, this person usually just look at the numbers on a very high level and if there's Any big disruption makes an input, but usually it just takes the word from the demand planner.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah. And for these ones, for requesters, we need to discuss it with the business to identify how many and at which business units they should be placed.

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, but the only thing is, Nikita, that the suggestion for row 18 and 19 should happen only after we validated row 20, like where they're sitting today at what level. So if we have clarity on requester, then the decision of demand planner and at what level it should be would become more specific. So I don't think we should directly go and tell them that there should be a centralized role at a shared service level unless we know at what level demand requesters as it includes.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
I understand your point, Rahul, but then the question is, at which point we are going to centralize the demand?

Patel, Rahul:
What do you mean by centralize the demand?

Bastian Osorio:
Someone looking at the demand from the different AGCs. Per individual AGC.

Patel, Rahul:
And I understand. OK, I agree with your point. So you are saying the demand planner is more of a centralized role, which looks at AGC demand at an AGC level. That rule probably does not exist today. And that's what we will recommend to have it as part of IBP. But then I don't want to go ahead with that discussion unless we know what is the fact on how the current work is happening. So I'm not disagreeing to your suggestion here.

 The only point I'm making is let's first get clarification on what level demand requesters are working today. And if we know for sure, if they're already working at AGC level, then probably we may not even need a centralization because they already have a centralized way. I'm not sure about it. So the only is let's give this clarity on how they're working today before we say that okay you need to have a role at centralized level yeah because just just maybe you you can answer but this is my idea

Bastian Osorio:
there well we were working you're not in Abu Dhabi right now I'm not in Abu Dhabi no yeah but in the eighth floor they have all these new desks that I understand is for for the shared services?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, but the shared service is only inventory shared service. Now, demand rules are not part of inventory shared services. That's the difference. Demand rules are part of AGCs, because AGC owns the demand, and the inventory shared services fulfills the demand, replenishes the demand. So when we say we want to make it centralized, the recommendation from us would be to create a demand shared service, which is not there.

 And which may not flow immediately. So if we have to recommend...

Bastian Osorio:
No, but just, we are not saying that the AGC shouldn't do their request. They still should do their request, but there will be someone from the shared services looking and maybe in some cases questioning in the good sense this demand coming from the AGCs. We're not taking the power from the AGC to say, do we need this or we need that? Absolutely not. The only thing is that we will have a role for the demand planning looking at the demand from different AGCs on a more medium and long-term horizon, considering that the AGCs are more focusing on just doing their job, drilling, maintenance, or whatever it is.

 Agreed.

Patel, Rahul:
But then if you are creating this role, then what is responsibility of the role, other than looking at demand. So if I am a demand, I'm a shared service resource looking at, say, demand for chemical for all the agencies, what value am I adding to the demand?

Bastian Osorio:
So first of all, this person will be the one running the forecast, looking at the numbers, and questioning if, let's say, you've been consuming, I don't know, 10 pieces every month for a given category. And all of a sudden, the demand request will put, I don't know, 50. So the demand planning will have a meeting with the request and say, what is happening here? Why 50? So they don't trigger the purchase of unnecessary materials.

 OK, got it.

Patel, Rahul:
So what you're saying is the centralized role is responsible for exhibiting the steps in IPP so that the forecast can get generated. And then basically the requester is someone who is looking at their specific materials and confirming whether it is OK or not OK at their specific agency level. And then if they suggest a change, then the demand planner at a shared service level.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
OK. But also in the system, right? Also in the system.

Bastian Osorio:
Correct. Yeah. Because look, let's look at it on the other way around. This role doesn't exist. Someone as a requester put a number, any number. So we're saying that this number, there's no one looking at this number, questioning this number, and not pulling until it gets the purchase approval.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed.

Patel, Rahul:
So I think this rule essentially would, if we take this discussion to AdNoc, essentially inventive planners or inventive controllers will end up having this rule. But then this is not clearly identified in the current process flows, which means that if we this clarity on how they're happening today, we need to go back to AdNoc and tell them that based upon we looked at your process, this is what we recommend an additional rule for say inventory controller to look at AGC-wise demand and confirm, which means I'm just coming up with some assumptions.

 But yeah, we need to have this discussion and make sure AdNoc agrees to this eventually.

Patel, Rahul:
Okay, I think we've had sufficient conversation around it, let's move ahead.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, let's go to the next category, which will be what?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Drilling?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, for drilling, let's just start repeating the same exercise that we've just done for chemicals. Maybe somebody just out of you guys take the lead and comment.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So far we have two roles here, planner and manager. Planner and manager.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, and we also had here planner and manager.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So drilling is only applicable to HQ, Offshore, Onshore, Saugus, Aliasat, Aldaphra, as the ones related to Onshore and Offshore. Yeah, but essentially the drilling is driven by Onshore and Offshore only.

Patel, Rahul:
The Aliasat and Aldaphra are managed through Onshore and Offshore only, because they don't have a separate team. Only sour gas as a separate team, but then they don't have any firm process, which means they will adopt the process of onshore and offshore only. That's what the agreement is. So essentially we have two agencies defining the process. And based on our understanding, drilling planner basically defines the demand and manager approves the demand.

 So in IBP.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
drilling lineup.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Creates drilling material demand in IBP.

Patel, Rahul:
Creates drilling material. Manages, creates, reviews, updates, manages. We can have multiple words there. Manages drilling material demand.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And this one.

Patel, Rahul:
Then you can define alerts and everything.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The manager.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so alerts will be applicable to define or review alerts. So basically, not define alerts, you can define that alerts is one of the roles and responsibilities, looking at alerts.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Looking at alerts, yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
For both of them. Yeah, for both of them. Bastion, Hector, the master data becomes part of which role?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
For drilling?

Patel, Rahul:
For everything, including drilling, for sure, but others as well. We have not talked about master data anywhere.

Bastian Osorio:
At least for MRO and chemical I'm a little bit more confused in drilling because it's more complicated, you know, and the the one this is another responsibility of the demo planet. He's the one looking at the data as well.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
He's basically the system owner.

Bastian Osorio:
So we can say. OK, so then he's the key. Of IGP. Manages master data. I have a different take on this.

Hector Palacios:
In one of the first projects that I had, we had one centralized guide that was called the master data admin. I think that I mentioned this before. And it's a guy that is taking care that the data is consistent on the system, basically that. But for all the AGCs? Yeah, yeah. I don't know if just one guy is going to be enough, but there needs to be someone that checks that the data is OK on the system and that can take action on S4HANA, whatever.



Bastian Osorio:
I think the question, Hector, will be who's doing that work now, because if they want to create a purchase requisition, the material needs to exist. So who's responsible for the material creation?

Hector Palacios:
Is at the AGC level or is at a different instance? Well, but the data is a complex topic and is something that needs to be right. So if we can put a main responsible which main responsibility is dealing with data, that should be a master data admin.

Bastian Osorio:
But the demand planner, I agreed on that he usually is not the responsible for the master data creation, but he is the responsible for giving, in some cases, the alert or saying, no, I mean, you need to create this data, whatever it is, in your instance, like in your end, but he's the one having the visibility of saying, you need to create that over there. I don't know if you follow what I'm trying to say.



Hector Palacios:
No, of course, in this role that I mentioned, this guy was communicating with everyone. Yeah, he was like, they have communication with the map planner, inventory controller, supply planner, and so on. But he's the main responsible for, I don't know, the combinations creation for making sure that material is on the system.

Bastian Osorio:
But how is that different from the demand planner? Because one thing is the master data creation itself, which is more like a technical thing. It's more an IT person just adding the codes with all the attributes, right? Yeah, checking the consistency of the master data and so on. That is more like a cleric job, but more from the system perspective, saying if someone says I need to, I need a new material.

 In many cases, it's the demand planner indicating the right step by step.

Hector Palacios:
It's always going to be the demand planner saying what material we need and so.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, it's like, OK, you need to go to IT, say they create the materials, then put the demand in the right key figure. And then with that, I will review it and see if I give you the thumbs up for the purchase requisition. But you're right in that the demo planet is not creating the material itself, but it's he's guiding the process. Yeah, but yeah, it could be also the

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The

Patel, Rahul:
Understands the data, but he may not technically bring in data and IBP, but highlight if any data is missing, right? Because he those materials, he understands materials, he understands what is the impact of planning a material. But if the material itself is not there for planning for some reason or showing wrong data, then probably he reaches out to say admin and say that, okay.

Hector Palacios:
The best data admin for me is someone like Dignich. He's a guy like that. That is where you check that the flows are running okay, that there's no rejection on data, that there is no inconsistency.

Patel, Rahul:
He's the technical guy. He does not own the data.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
But from a data perspective, business owns data, which means creation and updation of market data should be part of the business rules. Someone like PlanUp, making sure the jobs are running, making sure the data is moving between the systems, that's the technical admin guy, master data. Yes. Correct? Yes yes so which means that the master data maintenance still comes back as part of the responsibility of the planner the master what creation of master data in s4 hana I don't know how they are doing it today if they have centralized team for that or if they have access like like I don't know we will ask them but then And he's responsible if it's so far drilling.

 We know what they should write.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
So for drilling, we are proposing that the Bill of Metal should be there in S4 HANA. Right. If that's the proposal, which means that someone has to create Bill of Metal in S4 HANA and the admin will make sure that all the Bill of Metals created in S4 HANA are available in IBP. Correct. But if the Bill of Metal is not created, who owns the Bill of Metal? It's not the admin. It's the planner. He's a planner.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
He knows.

Patel, Rahul:
He knows. Correct. Which means managing master data would be the ownership of planner. For me, it's not clear.

Bastian Osorio:
It's something we need to discuss with them.

Hector Palacios:
Requesting the master data creation is the task of the planner.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, I think so. At the end of the day, the one creating the master data is like IT clerk. It's not the demo planner himself. But this is more from a business perspective, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
The IT clerk would never say, guys, but we already have this material in the system. That's why we are saying that the demo planner is going to be the main requester.

Bastian Osorio:
about some data, bit of material, but requester only.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. So, okay.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
We marked it here in the bottom. We'll come back to this question at some point. Let's focus on the business roles. And here we have manager and planner. The question is, do we need a demand request similar to what we discussed for chemicals here?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Do we need it for drilling?

Hector Palacios:
I don't think so, because on drilling they are like two business units. It's much more simple.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Bastian Osorio:
It's a more straightforward process.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
But maybe they have hundreds of drilling projects going on in parallel.

Hector Palacios:
But it's the same structure that they already have, probably. Sorry, say that again? It would be the same structure they have today. So they can have like hundreds of drilling projects in the world. They already have a figure that is consolidating, right?

Patel, Rahul:
So let's use the same. Yeah. So since drilling is happening, the planning is happening today. The planners and managers are already part of the drilling team today. The only thing changes for them is they are planning in Excel. Now they'll use IPP for planning. But Hector and Now today, I don't know if they are able to look at a holistic view or at ad-hoc level view of drilling. But tomorrow with IVP, they'll be able to have this ad-hoc level consolidated view for planning.

 I don't know if it will make sense to have something drilling. Maybe we do not suggest anything, but eventually they'll realize that they're having someone, at least a drilling manager somewhere has view of entire dealing.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense to me like the manager and manager. Yeah, drilling demand manager, something like that, looking at the aggregated consolidated demand.

Hector Palacios:
Real manager, I would say, see everything. Because I'm drilling, we are not separating demand planner or the inventory controller when they don't have one. Yeah, they do. The demand plan inventory controller, we are not separating that. We have just one role.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Hector Palacios:
Indeed, the guys that are doing the real demand planning job, they are outside IVP.

Bastian Osorio:
But you're saying the one planning the project and the one doing the purchasing process are the same person?

Hector Palacios:
There is one guy that is planning the work plan. Will continue to do the same way as it's doing today. They will just give us the input and then there will be a drilling planner that will check the PRs and all that information.

Bastian Osorio:
So in the entire process we have like from the execution perspective two roles. Let's call it well planner and then the supply planner. Yeah, demand request and then supply planner.

Patel, Rahul:
Their own words rather than we creating new, so they already have a drilling planner, right? So let's use and we recommend drilling plan. So let's continue using drilling planner.

Bastian Osorio:
So we have a drilling planner and then who's buying? Who's in charge of the purchasing process?

Patel, Rahul:
Purchasing is inventory only because the shared service, the purchasing shared service is also responsible for drilling.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, in that case, yeah we have these two roles for and but on the top of that we're saying a drilling manager yes so so we have the two roles of day one planner and manager from drilling then we have inventory planner and inventory manager so we have four roles underling cool yeah yeah I like it I agree on that Sorry, could you summarize?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Because at the same time, I was looking for the information from the business on this. At least that's for onshore. For offshore, I'm not sure we have anything on drilling. So Raul, these two roles will be centralized, right? I don't think so.

Patel, Rahul:
We need to have centralized. We would say that it would be same as today. They already have this rules defined today. We'll continue using same as today. Already drilling planning is happening. Since we are saying that the tool is changing, the people who are part of current planning organization, planner and manager, will continue to be same in IDP. So we just need to understand how the planners and managers are defined today and same people would be then will move their work from Excel to IBP.



Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
And we don't need requests as we discussed.

Patel, Rahul:
Got it.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Why is this happening? Okay. Drilling planar create. Kyle, it's probably you changing conditional formatting, yeah? Yeah, I fixed it. I keep on removing it. Okay, fine. Keep on doing it. Just realized um all right so I just add a couple of phrases here uh and I'll just mention that we don't need We don't need requesters. All right.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I think that's what we have for sure. Yeah, okay. So frequency, is the frequency the same monthly?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yep.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I guess this logic...

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, cool. For offshore to be, yeah, to be confirmed. All right, cool. Done with drilling, right? And we only have 10 minutes for today.

Patel, Rahul:
Which one we could take? Time, we can copy whatever we decide.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, whatever is here for drilling?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, unless we disagree, Bastian, Hector. For me, drilling is fine. Yeah, and the time is same as drilling, correct? Like, at least from the roles and responsibility. Whatever the drilling planet assembler happens for time.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
But is the mapping the same, more or less the same, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's the same.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
It is the same, yeah. Aldaphralia, Saat, Sour Gas, Ednok, onshore and offshore. Yeah, because time happens on the drilling wells, so it's the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's just the same process. Happening on the existing.

Patel, Rahul:
The process is different. Process is different. Tying is one of the material, but then from a rules responsibility, things do not change a lot. Yeah. So the tying planner is supposed to look at tying material demand and confirm if the demand is OK. And then the manager approves it. And one thing we need to check with tying, whether we We know there are separate planners, but we don't know if there are separate managers for time or the drilling manager also takes care of time.

 We just need to check that. If there is a separate org for time, we know there is separate, there are time planners are separate planners and drilling planners are separate planners. We know, we can verify this and also from a manager perspective, then is there a separate manager who is looking at tying and drilling or whoever from manager perspective is reviewing drilling also reviews the tying. We don't know for sure.

 So that probably if we can take this as one of the points to be checked for deadlock then yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Mhm. You.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
all right we have eight more minutes maybe we can spend we have so I think we've covered all the demand planning roles right or we also have I think we also marked the inventory controller to be oh it's applicable to demand classification and material segmentation.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so that's the only role it will have. So and it's important. So that way that we've completed the demand, right?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
In a way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. We just have process champions. But process champion, I guess there will be one or two people maximum, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah. So maybe one for MRN chemicals and one for say drilling can be process champion.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
But it's a new rule, which we are recommending, which is a very important role from AVP, because he has to orchestrate that process.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Sorry, guys.

Patel, Rahul:
He must be a senior person who can drive this process. And if he recommends something, he can make people accountable for their respective work. It cannot be a junior person following up here and there.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, and then we also touched from the governance perspective, we also touched this master data admin, right, which we'll discuss.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so probably you can quickly add this, since we have six minutes, there's more of making sure that the jobs are executing between the system, the system is getting data, things from an IT things are working fine. Data transfer between SAP and IBP are working. So the jobs are running fine. Interfaces, integration points.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Interfaces are working.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's a technical role. Yeah. Also, Hector and Bastian, would we need any additional role from a technical perspective who defines, say, say, key figures or defines new alerts or defines anything which is not business typical. Will we need any role in that area?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Hector Palacios:
It would be great, but for that they need to hire someone. It's not that we are going to teach them someone to configure an IDP.

Patel, Rahul:
Not from configuration, but from defining alerts, defining reports, dashboards.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I think that's awesome. Team, isn't it? That's Asmus team who are going to track performance, reporting, KPIs and all that stuff.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, but the process owner, the process champion is the one giving us that visibility. Okay, we need this new KPI and then the support team can work on it.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I think the process champion can agree with that.

Patel, Rahul:
process champion, you can say define KPIs, define dashboard requirements, process champion role. Yes, dashboard. But to configure key figures, that's out of the scope.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, yeah, I understand.

Patel, Rahul:
We need some work as well, right, as a consultant.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, they can hire one IGP consultant, internal IGP yeah yeah okay I had one more suggestion like idea because last time we identified this as a separate kind of set of activities demand classification and material segmentation right which is cross variant so my idea was do we need a champion for this one If it's a cross-variant, what do you think? Champion is not specific to a specific sub-process, but the entire IBP planning.



Patel, Rahul:
So if there's a champion for, say, MRO, then he has to make sure that the task related to, say, a demand classification on a quarterly basis are executed and completed. So it's not that you'll have a champion specific to a specific sub-process.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
So is that only going to be covered by the imagery controller, this activity, demand classification and material segmentation?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
That's it, yeah?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
This person, this role? Yes. Okay, that's fine. Then I just remove it.

Patel, Rahul:
So I guess next session would be our last session to conclude this discussion right because we've made quite some progress and the complicated process is covered so next probably is inventory and supply planning.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yes next will be inventory and supply planning and we'll finalize and then we will organize a discussion with Okay, we might go two ways. Raul, just a second. We might go two ways. We might include some of the findings and some of the key points from here into the change impact assessment. Or we could have it as a completely separate and detailed session with the business or both.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So we can also discuss it. Yeah.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Sorry, I interrupted you, Robert.

Patel, Rahul:
No, no. I think let's proceed with your recommendation. Let's conclude the next session. Make sure you have all the required data. And whatever points which needs business input, probably you can have this discussion. And then we'll take it from there. OK, which day?

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
I think one hour will be enough. We don't need it too long yeah so I think every february aligns as soon as possible tomorrow day after I don't know please suggest today yeah guys go asm and raul you suggest the date which is best working for you what about thursday maybe the day after the first of jan second of january Works for me if everyone is OK.

Patel, Rahul:
Same, probably the timing can be the same.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, I think it's comfortable for Go-CM team, like after 12, Dubai time. Yeah, this time is right. Also tomorrow, I don't know what you think, but yeah, on Thursday it will be OK.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, then let's do it. All right. Cheers. Last year in Hector, I planned a meeting with Vignesh right after this call, so let's switch to the meeting with Vignesh.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yes, let's go for it. Alrighty, thanks everybody. Bye. Happy New Year. Bye-bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Bye!
