So it's combining the transaction with the master data.\n\n This is okay. This is fine in terms of the structure. All these fields are used, I think, apart from this purchasing group.

When you go to MPLA call number or of items, just a second. On Verizon.

And I've opened up four tables in parallel. So what this talks about is, let's start from the beginning. So you have the table MPLA, which is the maintenance plan. Maintenance plan is associated information that you're getting for the maintenance plan. I'll just group it like this. And MHIM. So this is the maintenance plan information. Usually this is there in the header. This is also there in these views available.\n\n Then you have the maintenance item. This is available in these structures. If you are reading it in POS, it's fine. You just need to understand how to link up these four tables together right which is already the extractor is doing that okay strategy is part of mpus this is fine and then of course the package number so what happens is that let's say you have a maintenance plan for a pm okay uh it has a strategy it has all the details that you have uh at the header level right including all that stuff that you are mentioning over here uh for the scheduling type and scheduling status I don't think so this Part is there, but yeah, you're having all this information in the maintenance plan against the maintenance plan.\n\n You can have multiple items and that maintenance plan. Once that is called as you can see over here, it's kind of like a four yearly plan. So in the MHIS and MHI you will get the maintenance plan scheduling history as well as the forecast. So you have four calls over here. One of them is already completed. The other one is planned to be called in 2026. The scheduling type and status, as it was mentioned in the Excel sheet, will let you know which ones have been called and which ones are to be called, sorted over there like this.\n\n This will let you know what you were talking about, the status and everything. When you're looking out for the We'll get the equipment reference over here, right? Yeah, in the MPOS. And then of course, this location assignment is also there, which is kind of like the functional location. Of course, you need to use an additional table to get this deciphered into the functional location part. So if I go to that table, so I'll give you an example.\n\n You will have this location assignment put in in this table and you will get respective function location so and how it looks like and yeah can you go back to this to the file because you have the functional location there right and it's the same field yeah it is it is the object number which is not correct so I'll just update this part over here so you have functional location somewhere else I think I'm mentioning this over here so functional will be there in i8.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729578449021,"end_time":1729578450332,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Yeah that's right."},{"start_time":1729578450332,"end_time":1729578469996,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1"},"words":"This is Rahul, just one point.

So when you look at this basically you are passing the ILOAN number from MPOS and getting the TPLNR which is this one over here.\n\n This is the function location. This is the link relationship. Apart from that, I think these are the values that the extractor is building in because of IBP. I'm not going to comment on that. Number of calls is the count. If the extractor is just simply calculating the count of the numbers, this is fine. Otherwise, you also have this maximum value coming in over here in MPLA, which is also something that can be taken up, but this is better actually, this logic is okay.\n\n Apart from that, I don't see any other challenge.

If you're using the standard approach, this is OK. It is fine. You're getting the basically are getting the list of materials utilized. Inside the maintenance plan or item task list. Of course, you have the bomb categories and all that stuff over here. Task list type and bomb category is there, but Let me see if the It's not that over here for this one, build of material standard, meaning what?\n\n Let me give you an example of this part. Let me first run this for some entries over here so that you understand what is the Because unless these things are used in a maintenance plan, it won't serve any purpose, right? So let me open this task list and explain to you the over here and then come to that part. So this is a task list, right? It has two counters. Go to the operations. So these are all the operations for a task list.\n\n Against that, you are having components in the, or spare parts in the task list, right? But when I go and check this task list whether this has been used it can be used or it cannot be used right but in most of the cases in most of the group companies this is not the not the practice that they are following right you can see that this group has never been utilized in any of the maintenance plans right so Let me give you an example of the data.\n\n Basically, you are considering linking maintenance plan and task disk, and then from task disk, you are picking up the components and then doing the analysis. Let me just run all the task disk for A type. A type is general. I get this list over here. Of course, all these tasks have components in them. It's not like they don't have components. That's why this is table is populated, right? They have materials in them, but the question is the bigger question is whether they have been utilized.\n\n In the maintenance planning and scheduling.

But if the equipment does not have form to start up with which means that What happens to these improvements? That's the one question.

And also, we're going to look for going to share this file that Reinaldo was showing. So you can add all the different filters and additional attributes you might need. And also you can maybe think more about what else is needed in the integration. So I think today's Tuesday, we should be able to share that document this week. For sure. Remember that this is just an initial step, initial stage in all the integration design, because this is the focus of these three sessions were only in demand planning.\n\n In the future, we also will address integration for inventory planning and finally for supply planning.

So Reinaldo, I would request to share all the templates with me so that we can then circulate it and follow up on those templates.\n\n That's one thing. Second thing, probably, yeah, second thing probably we can discuss about is we have the next technical workshop which is when? Which is 5th of November. This is after we conclude the drilling session. Okay. On drilling. So we do not have any other technical workshops of next two weeks. Next two weeks because next week all the sessions are from a drilling perspective. And once the drilling is concluded, we can talk about drilling workshop.\n\n So that's what I was asking. Do we want to plan additional technical workshops in between for inventory? Because we will be concluding tomorrow, one of the inventory sessions. And considering that first inventory session is getting, hopefully gets concluded tomorrow. Next week, we should plan at least maybe one to at least one session from an inventory perspective from technical so that we can start the balls rolling for inventory.\n\n So next week we want to plan one session for technical inventory.

So Rahul, based on today's discussion, especially on the preventive maintenance, so initially we thought of only pulling the maintenance plan to IBP for further planning. But we also need to capture the historical data based on the work order. So process flow will also get changed. So we will align with the process tree, and then we'll update the process flow.\n\n Yeah. So before we say that's the only way, I would like to let's internally work on the proposed solution. I will need, as discussed, I'll need some inputs from Khalid, from production perspective, what are the facts and figures, so that we can put up of a plan A and plan B kind of thing. And then based upon AdMob's confirmation, what is the next, what is the way they want us to look at the data?\n\n We will then include that as part of the process. Sure. Okay. So I will, so I will, Khalid, I'll share with you what all things we need, and then probably we can then see how that data can be extracted. I don't need a but actually some numbers that we have already spoken to as well. But then we need to split that group company level so that we understand how we think. Okay. Okay, then that's it.
