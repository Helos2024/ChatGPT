So they send this FG material to like requirement will be sent from vendor plant to vendor but vendor in return will ask the component that is required to manufacture that header material. So for the components there will be a TLAN between like from vendor plan to vendor okay but I'm not because I'm not sure I'm not sure of that either so I would have I mean I will put it as for us to be fine okay okay yeah you can you can mention yeah to be checked or yeah because in the workshop they mentioned this though.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734525315184,"end_time":1734525322671,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"From adnob to vendor.
