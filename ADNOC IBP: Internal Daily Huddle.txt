So on one side, maybe Vivek and Arun were not, or they are not involved in feedback update for wave one documents.\n\n So you need to brief them.

I think MRO and chemicals, maybe drilling is still a challenge. When Raoul will join us, we'll see.

No, he's super fast. I mean, it's great to work with him because he replied in five minutes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the nice thing, he sits two seats away from Khaled.

Yes. Drilling data is missing, yeah. So we'll see what we can do with this.

But yes, this is needed for the training preparation, train the trainer, or the end users when we support them.\n\n Now for license, I think they should have done the homework. I can ask Suleyman from SAP. But from your side, you collectively as a team, maybe Who do we have between Kunal and Bastian? Who are the users or do you get one access to use demand, inventory, and supply? Is it one user?

So when we're referring to IBP and when we're showing the demo of who, I mean, what do you use for demand, for the supply, there are certain things that will be automatically done through integration. But the different screens we were showing, to highlight, I mean, to review demand or to check inventory policies if they're changing, and definitely to confirm supply.\n\n This is done by mainly the planners or controllers, they call, and the manager. Is that correct? More also from role perspective, you and Sheroze. So who's basically that main player? Because so many people are involved but indirectly. So for example, if I'm an ERP user, the moment I start basically consuming some items or buying them etc, this will feed into demand because it's consumption. Or it will feed into supply because I'm buying something or reserving or you know.\n\n But the direct user of IBP, are they logically just the planners and controllers or there is more that I'm missing?"},{"start_time":1734085680232,"end_time":1734085694000,"speaker":{"name":"Fakhouri, Mohamad"},"words":"So I would say yeah, planners, controllers, and also managers for reporting purposes.
