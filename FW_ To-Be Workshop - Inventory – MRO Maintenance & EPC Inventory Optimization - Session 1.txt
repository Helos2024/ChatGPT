Where we are right now, so we're conducting those design workshops. As-is assessments in the SS, as well as we've prepared the demo. What's coming up is the gap closure. So for each of those modules, we're gonna close those open items.

So part of the strategic vision could be, for example, have an optimal operation performance. I think most likely this is the case of AppDocU, which implies to have a minimum production time, right?\n\n Sorry, a minimum production time, minimum production downtime, which of course can only be possible by performing the right activities, corrective and preventive activities. But then for that, you need the right safety stock. You need to have the right spare parts at your different warehouses. Then of course you need to have some kind of control for profitability and for how much you need to buy it, right?\n\n And here you need to find the right balance. And it is very important to have a solid business process and good technology to calculate the right level of stock, otherwise you will end up overstocking out or overstocking. But then you have another aspect of the operational performance and inventory planning that sometimes are not covered. For example, scalability. What if I want to enlarge my operation?\n\n Do I have to duplicate or even triple my safety stock. Of course, if the right business process with the right technology is completed, that is not the case. It's not needed. You will be way more efficient. And finally, sustainability. If you have the right, like, efficient operation, it's an operation generate less waste. And that makes it more sustainable. Okay. So as you can see, inventory planning has multiple implications that goes beyond having the right materials to perform, but it's more like, at least at this time of operation, a crucial aspect of the business.\n\n I think we can jump into the next slide. So coming back again to this process that we have seen before, we have four like big part of the business of the maintenance and operation planning process and of course we are in the second step of calculate inventory policies, which is safety stock and reorder point. And this will be the final output will be at material and location level. In the time bucket, it's monthly.\n\n Of course, there will be some activities that will be performed on a quarterly basis. But in general, let's say we're going to run the process on a monthly basis. And just one thing, to run this, to perform, to execute this part of the process, we need the output from demand, of course.

As I said, the main inputs to this inventory planning part are Well, we'll see some of the aspects, of course, of the master data. But in terms of process, the main input is the forecast, the spare part forecast. With that, we're going to generate the inventory policies that are reordered point and safety stock.\n\n And in some cases, we're going to integrate this result to S4HANA. And for the other cases, continue to supply planning. So, that distinction is something that will be addressed in the following slides.

The first step in this process is to define the MRP type for materials, and we have a subsequent slide that proposes options on how we will be defining these MRP types, which are basically your external planning or reorder point planning. The second step, on a monthly basis, you finalize the average weekly rate.\n\n Then you move on to validate the data inputs, which are service level, forecasted error average you delayed etc. Yes that's the okay then on monthly basis you run the inventory planning job the system then analyzes and recommends inventory parameters such as safety stock reorder point target inventory position and then there's an awful step to run what-if analysis we also have slide on this to explain these what-if analysis scenario planning.\n\n Based on this, we finalize the approvals to release the final results.

He needs to manually evaluate the month, right? So Murugan, one suggestion here, for safety stock only to vital items and not to other items. Yeah, okay.

Then we have, of course, the material dimension. We have covered this before. And of course, during the technical session, we will determine what are the different attributes that we're going to integrate to be able to look at the information at different levels.\n\n And then we have location dimensions. And at this point, I need to also mention that when we say location, we are also talking about suppliers. So we need to define attributes to aggregate our plants. When I say location, I don't mean functional locations or asset, I mean specifically plants. So we can aggregate them here, for example, in geographic region, country, so on and so forth, but also we need to define what are the attributes that we're going to use to maybe group our suppliers, okay?\n\n But it's something that will be defined in the technical session. One final point regarding the master data of this slide is that we're not here the inventory model doesn't considers functional locations. I think in doing demand sessions, we said that the demand will be defined at location plan, but also functional location or cost center in your own language. In this case, the inventory policies, the safety token reorder point is defined at material location.\n\n And it's not possible. It's not recommendable. It's not the best practice. It's not good because we'll increase the level to define it at a lower level like plant and cost center. So let's jump into a little bit in more details about the master data. Well, location and MRO part or materials, we already covered that. Target unit of measure is more standard, you are able to visualize the safety scope or any figure in different units that you have available in the system.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729494136536,"end_time":1729494137363,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Sorry?"},{"start_time":1729494137363,"end_time":1729494140668,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Is there a question?"},{"start_time":1729494140787,"end_time":1729494143508,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"We need to mute."},{"start_time":1729494143508,"end_time":1729494150993,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Folks, if you don't have a question, please can you mute?"},{"start_time":1729494150993,"end_time":1729494351901,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Okay, as I was saying, a target unit of measure, we will cover, we will integrate the different units that you have available in your system. And that, of course, adds some value to your analysis. There's no point to integrate, like, 15 different units of measure if you're not going to use them. Then we jump into the composed master data. Here we have, for example, no, no, for example, this is one of the main ones, the transportation lane, which, of course, indicates the relationship from supplier and plant for each material.\n\n So at this point, we need to define the lead time. How long does it take to go from the supplier to the plant? And this lead time is since you place the order up to you receive the material and the material is available to be used. So if there's any processing time, is there any additional time that needs to be considered? We need to put it. We need to consider it for the lead time calculation. I think the way to calculate this lead time is something that will also be covered during the technical session.\n\n And then we also have lot size. I'm pretty sure the most critical and more expensive parts will have a lot size of one, the minimum amount you can request is one. But for some other materials, let's say, I don't know, bearings and like materials that are consumed in high volumes, the load side could be a larger number. So it's something that we also need to address, right? It's maybe, I don't know, the forecast or the inventory says something like you can order, I don't know, you should have I don't know, 536 units.\n\n But it's not possible to order that. You only can order multiples of 1,000. So that is what I mean when I say lot size. Then we have the location material. I think for most SAP users, this has a relation with the MARC table, and it's the relation of a material with a plant, okay? So at this point here, we're going to integrate some key, some very important attributes as stocking or non-stocking indicator, which basically indicates if the material can be stored at this location.\n\n We are going to also integrate the current safety stock and reorder point, which is 90B, is called ERP safety stock or ERP reorder point, the MRP type, which will determine the replenishment strategy, EOQ, economic order quantity, and some others that we'll define during, again, the technical sessions."},{"start_time":1729494351901,"end_time":1729494356247,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"OK?

This is what we are going to do. In a nutshell, we are going to calculate the safety stock, as you see here, the reorder point, the maximum stock, that sometimes you can see that like the target inventory position, and then also the economic order quantity.\n\n If you don't have it as an input, we also can calculate it. As you know, all this is about to calculate stock, so we can buffer against the uncertainty, because we can plan to have, I don't know, a consumption of 10, but reality can be different. And for that reason, we have the safety stock. You can see here that in one of the cycles of the replenishment, we went below the safety stock. That's not what we are planning, but it's what in reality is going to happen.\n\n And that is the reason in the first place why we have safety So we have some formulas that we are going to explore. Please don't take this as a final formula because depending on the case, we are going to calculate in the system the safety stock or directly the reorder point. We are going to show the models, but this is the relationship between them. So if we calculate safety stock, then we can know the reorder point or the other way around.\n\n Then you have the maximum stock. The IVP formula is exactly the one that you have on the inventory policies. Is the reorder point plus the EOQ. And finally, the economic order quantity is what we were discussing, where the D is the demand, S is the purchase cost, if I'm not wrong, and H is the holding cost. So, we are going to need to integrate that information. If you want us to calculate this in the system, then we can do it.\n\n Now, something that is really important to understand is that all this information is going to make sense only if we have the reorder point replenishment. As soon as we go with the supply plan in IVP, the only thing that we are going to consider is the safety stock, because the order quantity, the frequency, all of that is going to be determined by the algorithm. That is also going to consider constraints on the supply chain network.\n\n For example, the load size that you have from your vendors, the lead times, if we need to anticipate something and so on. So all of these smart decisions are going to go beyond a real death point and are going to be determined by advanced data. Right, so let's continue. So here we have the supply chain network from the vendors, the plants, and different economies. So I guess these are your operation sites.\n\n And we are going to need different inputs from this supply chain to calculate the safety stock parameters. So first of all, the demand rate. Understand how much we are consuming. Then we also have the lead times, not only between the vendors, but between the plants. We just know that between the plants probably it's going to be zero, so we can disregard that. Sourcing quotas, this is what Bastian was saying.\n\n Sometimes when you have between echelons, for example, this is your operation site, and then you have two plants that are sourcing that operation site, then to propagate demand, we need to know in which amount they are buying, so they are transferring the stock, so we can assign proper demand to these plants as well, to calculate the safety stock and all of that. Inventory holding policy, if you are keeping inventory or not, I guess for some materials you are not going to give a stock, so in that case we don't want to propose a safety stock level, and that is an important input to have in consideration, so the system will not calculate calculate any policy in these cases.\n\n Demand variability and supply variability, of course, if we can. All right. So these are the main inputs. Then later we can explore some more. You also have the economic order quantity, but this is not an input for the optimization per se. We are going to use it just to calculate the maximum stock level, but this is not going to affect the safety stock or the real debt. All right. So these are the inputs.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729496089504,"end_time":1729496113965,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Abdul, for anybody from onshore drilling, where we have stocked separately for JV and ASR, I hope this Ekland 2 plant-wise stock and having a quota against each plant will optimize your safety stock, even ROP.
