The material attributes would be, this is also called classification in S4 HANA. So basically, you will have the weld type, the field, the completion code, and two additional attributes you will have on S4 HANA, which is stock type. But this block material is whether for ad-hoc stock, And the fifth one would be the vendor, which means this bill of material is for which vendor.\n\n With this five attributes on bill of material header, we can identify which bill of material is applicable for which case. So the first three attributes, the field, the weld type, and then the completion code will basically help us with the weld type definition. And the last two attributes are the different vendors and stock combinations. So probably we can start with AdNoc stock as the first variety.\n\n And then we need to define this prioritization in IDP where we can say that AdNoc stock is the first priority and the VMI stock is the second priority. And within AdNoc stock, probably vendor one is one priority, vendor two is second priority. And then same goes. And VMI stock vendor one and vendor two are first and second priority. So if we are able to define this prioritization in IBP side, which means the bill of materials can be imported from S4 HANA.\n\n And then those bill of materials directly can be referred in IBP as input for which materials are applicable.
