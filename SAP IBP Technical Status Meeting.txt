Right, right. That is mandatory actually for me, OK? Kajal's thing takes longer time. That's not a problem. Get email approval from the from the design point of success. You know the SDD point of view, the architectural point of view. It's OK from visa and also Kaiser Kaiser. Anyway, part of your project you can get it from him and then there were some requirements in the BRD actually right approval from the business.\n\n I think that you need to have and third thing is removal of this phase two. I just keep only phase one and accordingly adjust the dates. You know points which which were there.

Then the enterprise architect and then there is a few other people like security and compliance.\n\n Few other people actually involved there. So one that is approved that is actually enterprise architecture approval for SDD. That is, you know the architectural approval. Actually that is something which you can even if it takes, See what I said on the design board point of views to start the development. I you can accelerate it just by getting email approval or you know endorsement from either that is OK with that.\n\n That's all I feel you need. Yeah, so you don't have to wait for the year. I think he will. Maybe sometime it takes longer time. So I don't want you to get held up on it. That's why I'm just giving you an easier option. Get users overall approval. I'm in the endorsement saying he's OK with the design. You know endorses it. Then you have the business requirement document approval from the business, right?\n\n We didn't have the approval from the business. That's why we need to get approval from the business saying that.

I think there is some add-on may be required. I'm not sure, but whatever the hardware and infrastructure thing that is required.
