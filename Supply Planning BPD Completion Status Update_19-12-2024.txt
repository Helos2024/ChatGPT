If we need a clarification, address it. Maybe a few things slip, but we closed. That's why I'm not concerned about us adding whatever details could be missing and closing this.\n\n Where I'm concerned is us internally as a team. So Raoul, Kunal, Mosh, Rocio, Arun, Vivek, the rest, it seems we're not on the same page. That's my high level or basically because I'm coming from outside. This is what I'm sensing. If that's the case, I think just addressing this should be the first thing. Then later on, adding the content would be much easier. Because if Arun is saying, yes, I'm not sure about this, but sure about that, and Rocio is repeating it, then that's my suggestion.\n\n I think so that we don't spin wheels. It's Thursday and the whole idea was for us to reduce feedback later on, which logically means we know exactly how to formulate the content that to be added. I'll stop here, that's my observation. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, but I'll let you also figure out what's the best way to bridge any gap in understanding. I know we have the three areas, drilling, MRO, chemicals, so hopefully we can between Vivek and Arun, okay?\n\n Yeah, yeah, sure. We can talk tomorrow or I mean the huddle might be too quick or too close to get any update but at least for tomorrow we can connect again. Thanks.

Arun, just to answer your point regarding the drilling, so see drilling is the complex topic compared to the MRO and chemicals. Everyone we know, right, and today's also it was a big challenge and And Abdul Latif was not in agreement to even fill our template, which we shared with them. Now, how to convince them? See, ultimately, the document which we're going to share with Abdul Latif and Ashik, they'll send it to their actual team member, right?\n\n And they're going to each and every part. And they'll say, it is not aligned with that. So what we have done is, all the requirement, Mo as well as Sheroes has captured in the BRD. So BRD is the requirement, specifically. Able to address in a IBP how what will be the detailed solution point of view so if that part is covered then we are hundred percent sure that whatever issue you are having in drilling that will be addressed to the IBP supply plan so that is the point we have added those requirement now how to capture those solution part that we need to think through and then we can discuss in the larger group larger group along with Rahul, Bastian as well as Hector because drilling is the very complex topic they are expecting a lot of thing from IBP they are expecting DWS EWDP still master data does not exist in S4 HANA so that is also one of the challenge for us for offshore business onshore they are having their they were saying but I am also doubt so drilling is a very key point and now time is also open for us so that's why I don't you need to deep dive into that and see there are a lot of comments more than 100 comments ad hoc team has specified in our demand and inventory bpd so to avoid that issue again and for the supply planning at least we we should be having a very smooth transition for the approval part so due to that reason better try to cover as much as possible so that everything are captured and then we can have a easy easy go"},{"start_time":1734615199388,"end_time":1734615232034,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"during the approval session with them okay so the requirement that that are updated in the document right I'll go through them okay and if required I'll add our details in the respective sections okay or else I I just highlighted those in green or something okay then maybe you can review and you can take care of it sure sure see drilling park rahul rahul basian hector and I will review together so that we are 100 whatever we have discussed,"},{"start_time":1734615232034,"end_time":1734615255529,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"understood, and we have captured in the BPD document.
