So hello everyone. Very good afternoon to all of you. I'm Vivekanand Gajula from technology stream. So before I start demonstrating the following three use cases in the system, let me give you a high level picture of the end to end flow. We are now at this stage of supply generate supply plan in SAP IBP. We need a demand inputs like demand forecast, which is going to come from the demand planning application of SAP IBP.\n\n Then we need inventory policies like reorder point and safety stock, which is going to come from the inventory planning application of SAP IBP. And then we also need master data like plans, materials, et cetera, and also the transactional data like stock on hand, in transit, et cetera, which is going to come from the S4 system. So once we have all these inputs on the supply planning side, we are good to generate the supply plan.\n\n So what SAP IBP for supply is going to do is it is going to consider all these inputs. And based on that, it is going to give you three main outputs. So number one, distribution plan, which represents the movements between your end internal locations. Number two, procurement plan which represents the movements between your vendor and your internal location. And number three, alerts if there are any.\n\n So following three use cases, we are going to see in the system. So before we jump into the system, let me briefly talk about all the three use cases so that you get the context. And then we also have some examples to show you so that this will help you in understanding the system in a much better way. Let me switch to presentation mode in a second. Yeah, so the first use case that we are going to see in the system is the reorder point planning.\n\n So in reorder point planning, there won't be any demand for us you know as such so all you will have is the reorder point itself you know so whenever your stock on hand goes below the reorder point system is going to first check you know if there is any access supply you know at any of your internal locations if there is it is going to use that and even after using that access supply it is still below your reorder point then it is going to trigger you know the supply okay so that is it is going to generate the procurement proposals.\n\n Then the second use case that we are going to see in the system is advanced supply planning. So in advanced supply planning, you will have your demand forecast as well as the safety stock. And both demand forecast and safety stock are going to drive the supply planning. So in this, basically what will happen is whatever existing supply you have at a location, system is going to use that existing supply to meet the demand forecast and also to cover the safety stock.\n\n So wherever you know your projected stock is going below the safety stock there you know the system is going to trigger you know the supply. So before triggering the supply right it is first going to check you know if there is any excess you know supply at any of your internal locations. If you already have any excess supply it is going to utilize that and then for the unfulfilled you know maybe forecast or for the portion of of safety stock, which is not getting covered.\n\n For that, it is going to generate the procurement proposals. So the major difference between reorder point planning and the advanced supply planning is that in reorder point planning, you won't have any forecast, whereas in advanced supply planning, you will have the forecast. And also in advanced supply planning, you are planning well in advance so that your projected stock, whenever it tries to go below your safety stock, system is going to trigger the supply plan to improve planning you know situation whereas same is not the case in reorder point planning whenever you go below whenever your stop on hand goes below the reorder point then only you know you trigger you know the supply and the third use case that we are going to see in the system is six months of coverage okay so in this what is that we are going to show you in the system is that whatever you know demand forecast you have so to cover you know next six months of demand whatever coverage you need you know as of this month so that is what you know we can see in the system so what the system is going to do is system is going to smartly you know build up the inventory okay in such a way that you are always in a position you know to meet next six months of you know demand forecast okay so so before you know we get into the system let me you know show you some examples you know so that you you can understand you know the system in a much you know better way okay so this is the first you know example that we have for reorder point you know planning so we took some assumptions you know over here for example let's say your reorder point is three your lead time is two months and your lot size is let's say you know five now when you were in the month of september you had stock on hand of six okay you are already you know above your reorder point so you are doing good you know in the month of september now out of that six you know you consumed you know one unit so that leaves you with a stock on hand of five you know post consumption then with this stock you move to the month of october and in the month of october you have a stock of five you are still above your reorder point and out of this five you consumed you know two and that leaves you with a stock on hand of three you know post consumption now in the month of October if you see your stock on hand is equal to your reorder point but that is still you know okay now we move to the month of November which is the current month this is where we are you know at present now now in the month of November you consumed you know two units and that leaves you with a stock on hand of one you know post consumption so as your stock on hand has gone below below your reorder point so what the system has done is it has triggered you know a new supply so as the lead time is 2 months vendor is shipping you know the material in the month of November and you are going to receive it in the month of January and it is 5 because your lot size is 5.\n\n So let me take a pause over here and ask you if you have any comments or any questions before Now we move to the next example."},{"start_time":1731403111373,"end_time":1731403125265,"speaker":{"name":"Arunkumar Viswanathan (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"In our earlier session, we have defined or we have asked you to populate the max stock level, wherein the max stock level is not at all considered in this scenario."},{"start_time":1731403125265,"end_time":1731403145007,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"No, this 5 is what we are calling it as max stock and that is replaced you know as a lot size in the system.

Second part is the lead times of most of our materials is a minimum of 4 months or something.\n\n So, generally we are trying to replenish at least for a given year.

And that's why we presented an approach to define which material are going to follow the replenishment choice of reordered point and which one are not. I think at this point, one of the main benefits for reordered point of IDP is the calculation of the reordered point itself. For the reorder point itself, as we saw during the inventory workshops, there's plenty of machine learning and different algorithms that estimate the right value to optimize your stock.\n\n But again, as I said, the reorder example here is pretty basic. It's just to showcase this specific example where the system will determine no more than reordered points needed because these are very simple products, simple materials with very short lead time and stable demand pattern, and finally, inexpensive items. So this example is very specific to, again, very easy to plan items, materials. Then for the most complex products, Aysha, for example, rare consumption or very unstable demand patterns, we will follow a different logic which is more sophisticated.\n\n That is called advanced supply planning. That has a very close relation or is in fact – I don't know, Vivek, if you can come back to the slide of the constraints, hard constraints. Yeah, so this is what we will consider for advanced supply planning. So we will have multiple plants. We will have the multiple consumption centers where we have the functional location. We will have multiple vendors. And we have here lead time, load sizes, material constraints, storage capacity, plant calendars, frozen horizon quotas, and so on and so forth.\n\n This image that we're showing here where we have all these different variables is related to advanced supply planning.

So before you know we jump into the system so so whatever use cases you know we are going to see in the system. So to model all those use cases we have defined, you know, a supply chain network and system. So let's quickly, you know, take a look at that. So. So we have two ad-hoc locations. One is in Abu Dhabi, and the other one is in Ruwais. So Abu Dhabi can take from two different vendors. That is vendor one, and the other one is vendor two.\n\n So vendor one is preferred over vendor two, maybe because he's offering you the best price, and also the lead time is lower as compared to getting it from vendor two. And then on the other hand, we have revised you know location which can take you know from vendor to it can also take you know from Abu Dhabi provided you know Abu Dhabi has any excess supply and the lead time between Abu Dhabi and revised is zero okay and both the locations you know are having some you know chemical materials.\n\n Now let me go to the system okay so before we go through you know the scenarios in the system. Let me spend a few minutes on SAP IBP tool so that you all get a feel of it. So SAP IBP is a cloud-based application and it comes with two user interfaces. The first one is the Excel user interface, which is mainly used by the planners for carrying out their day-to-day planning activities. And this is what you are seeing on your screen.\n\n And the other interface that we is the web user interface, which is mainly used by the configuration experts. It can also be used by the planners, by the supply chain managers, director, and even by higher management to view analytics, to gain more insights into your data, and to draw meaningful outputs out of it, which in turn will help your business community to make informed decisions. So now, on the top, if you see, this This is the regular Excel that you are all using it in your day-to-day life.\n\n So on the top, you have different tabs. So likewise, you have a dedicated tab for SAP IBP. And this tab, you will only see when you install a special add-in on your machine. So once you log in into the system, it automatically connects you to the cloud system. And once you log in, on the top, all the functions and features of SAP IVP Excel interface gets activated. So depending on the access that you have, you may or you may not see all the features of the Excel interface.\n\n Then on the right-hand side corner, we have these templates. This is where all your planning templates will reside. So planning template is very important. So this is where you see all your planning specific information, whether it's your inputs coming from demand planning or coming from you know inventory planning and you know whether it is coming from exporana so everything you know you you see under this planning template and even the system you know proposed numbers also you see in this planning template and then we have this master data section so this is where you see all your master data whether it's a plant master whether it's your material master whether it's your bill of material master so all your master data you know resides you know under this section Now let me show you the template.\n\n So this is the planning template. This is how it loads. So before I navigate you through different tabs of this template, let me talk about two important terms which you would hear quite often during the course of the project. So one is key figure. So whatever transactional data we have in SAP IBP, whether it's your reorder point, whether it's your safety stop, or whether it's your stop on hand they they are called as key figures you know in SAP IVP and this key figures you know they they are seen in SAP IBP with respect to master data and time for example I have this reorder point you know key figure so I'm looking at this reorder point you know for Abu Dhabi you know location and for so and so material and with respect you know to monthly package so these key figures will hold you know the values and then we have attributes you know so these are nothing but you the master data for example which plant it is or which material it is so these are nothing but the master data you know attributes now if you look at this planning template at the bottom you know there are different you know tabs so each tab you know has some specific you know information to show so uh and all this you know can be personalized you know as per the planners you know requirements now coming to this reorder point planning use case so we have two uh locations you know one is supply planning Sorry.\n\n"},{"start_time":1731407262523,"end_time":1731407269385,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Advanced supply, not the rear of the point. Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay. Yeah, thanks."},{"start_time":1731407269385,"end_time":1731407590476,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"So yeah, so we have this, you know, advanced supply planning use case. So we have two locations over here. One is Abu Dhabi and the other one is Ruwais and on both the locations, you know, you have a chemical, you know, material. So in Abu Dhabi, the lead time is 3 and 4 hours, the lead time is 5. And at both the locations, you have the demand, which is directly coming from the demand planning application of SAP IBP.\n\n And then you also have the safety stock, which is coming from the inventory planning application of SAP IBP. And at both the locations, we have some stock on hand as well. Now let's look at the situation at Abu Dhabi. So if you look at Abu Dhabi, your stop on hand is 7. And with this 7, you are able to cover the demand of November month. And that leaves you with a projected stock of 6. And you continue with that.\n\n So with this 6, you can cover December's demand. And your projected stock is 3. So you are still able to cover your safety stock. And then when you go to the month of January, and after fulfilling the demand of January, you are falling below your safety stock. And that's why it is highlighted in red. So that is an alert. The system is trying to tell you something. Your projected stock has gone below the safety stock.\n\n So as you are still within your lead time, it cannot generate any receipt. And also, the other thing is Abu Dhabi only takes from vendor. It doesn't take from any of your internal locations. So that is the reason why it is not generating any recept you know over here. Okay. Oh, just a minute. Yeah, so sorry for the pause. Okay, so and whenever you have an alert, you know, in SAP IBP, you see all those alerts you know in this alert you know dashboard so so one alert that we got is really which is related to projected stock and it also tells you you know in which uh template you know you have that alert and how many alerts you know you have okay so now now if you look at the month of february right it generates a recept of five okay because of the lot size and your projected stock situation you know has improved now okay so now you uh you already have had a projected stock of two in January with that you can fulfill you know February months demand fully and all you need is three but your lot size you know is five so it generated a recept of five now if we switch to revise you know and if you notice something then at revise you know something interesting you know happened in the month of you know February so let's let's go through you know the plan for revise now revise has a stock of 12 okay and has an independent demand of 3 and its safety stock is 3 in the month of November.\n\n So after fulfilling the demand, you are left with a projected stock of 9. And with this 9, you can cover your safety stock easily. And this goes on till the month of Jan. Now in Jan, you have a projected stock of 3. And with this 3, you are able to cover this demand of 1 from the month of February. And this is where the projected stock is going below the safety stock. So what the system has done is, as you have access at Abu Dhabi, so instead of generating a new supply, it used that access so that your procurement is optimized.\n\n So it used that access from Abu Dhabi in both February as well as in the month of March. And this is what you can see in the distribution plan. So here, if you see, Ruwais is taking from Abu Dhabi in the month of February and in the month of March. Okay and then from you know maybe April onwards they are on their own okay so so if you see the projected stock situation has improved you know for both the locations and you are above you know your safety stock and that's your you know procurement plan so so Abu Dhabi is taking from vendor one because vendor one is offering you know the best price and reverse is taking you know from vendor two and and we have also you can also you know do dollarize this plan and that you can see it in the procurement cost tab.\n\n So you have so here it is paper but for each you know unit of your chemical material you can have the cost and that cost you can multiply it with your procurement you know plan to have the procurement cost. And this you can view it at the quarterly level at whichever level you know you like to view it you can you can live at that level.

So in this case, Vivek showed how we're transferring soft from basically from Ruiz to Abu Dhabi to Ruiz because we have an excess stock.\n\n So in order for that to happen in the system, we will need the different transportation lanes, okay?

Now, one thing we discussed that same chemicals may have different part number in different group companies.\n\n This was discussed that there is already ongoing project to basically have a common generic part numbers. Because when we do the stock transfer planning between plants, if the part numbers are not same, we'll not be able to know where you have the available inventory if the part numbers are different across the plants. Then we talked about prioritization of vendors for supply planning. First priority is the lowest price.\n\n And if the price are same, the second priority is the lowest lead time. We talked about consolidation criteria. There is a requirement to have consolidated purchase requisition to be considered when creating PR from IBP. We do not want one separate PR for every material and vendor. It was discussed that AdNoc will share the technical specification of logic being used today, and same would be implemented in IBP so that whenever IBP is creating purchase requisitions, we are consolidating the creation of purchase requisitions.\n\n One additional thing what was discussed on vendor specific unit of measurement.

Probably, we can look at there are any workarounds to identify this in IBP if there is no so field availableness for Anna. Then coverage based planning yes so basically we just wanted to understand on why a certain model has to be ROP based planning versus coverage based planning so we discussed both definitions of what is ROP-based planning versus coverage-based planning.\n\n So we've got an input that all production chemicals used period-based or coverage-based planning, where one month forecast is something which is targeted as a coverage. And then in refining, the ROP-based planning is used, essentially, which means that stock goes below ROP. Then the planning is triggered. So these are the two probably will put for rest of the group companies so that we understand how a different group company is using ROP or safety stock based planning versus coverage based planning.\n\n We also discussed that open reservations to be considered for supply planning and then open PO and STO to be considered for supply planning. So both these points are captured. We also discussed that if the stock in hand plus open PO is less than ROP, then trigger procurement. So procurement should not be triggered only based on ROP. But we also should look at what are the open PRs and PO. And then combination of stock and open PR PO, if it is less than ROP, then only trigger the procurement.\n\n For direct delivery model, replacement should be based upon the max tank size capacity. Safety stock should not be considered is what we've discussed. And then historical transfer order can be used to different transportation lanes for stock transfers between plant. So we already have open point from the previous discussion on planning at storage location level. So that's why I have not captured here.\n\n But if required, we can capture here again.
