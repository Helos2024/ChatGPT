Okay, let's start. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the, now we're on our third workshop. So, today what we'll be discussing is the, planning for chemicals. So most of you are now aware of the flow. What we'll be discussing is we'll have an introduction. We'll go over that quickly because I see a lot of familiar names. Then we'll go over the demand planning process flow. We'll talk about master data for the demand planning.\n\n Then we'll go over the demand classification and segmentation. After that, it's the pre-processing step. Then we talk about the forecasting, how the system will do a statistical forecast, as well as the new chemical introduction. And then lastly, the collaboration. So what's the objective? So similar to all the workshops, what we'll be doing is that we're going to give you a walkthrough of the process, so for chemicals, and then we'll demonstrate how SAP IBP will support the process as well as your business requirements.\n\n So part of that is that we're going to go over and then ensure that these activities are, um. Are fit and any activities or requirements that are not fit. We're going to assess them. See identify if there are a gap. And then from there, we need to, uh, find a solution of how we can adjust those gaps. Some. Now because we're also a business process will change. So we need to also identify what are these processes that will change.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729145561067,"end_time":1729145598759,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"So from a timeline perspective or from a workshop perspective, what we've done is previously we've done the assess phase. So we conducted as assessments to understand your business. We've also, in parallel, we were also preparing this system for the design workshops. Currently, now we are holding those design workshops, so we're showing you the leading practices as well as the demo. The next phase is that we're going to, after we conduct all these workshops, right, we're going to gather all those.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729145602289,"end_time":1729145614240,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"those gaps, and then we need to close those gaps.

Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining. So this is the high-level maintenance and operation planning process, okay? And as we have seen throughout all the last session, we're going to focus on the demand planning process. And as you know, as we have seen, The main output of this process is the grid material forecast, add material and location level, and we will update, we will run this process on a monthly basis.\n\n A few observations on this. First of all, of course, IVP will give us long-term visibility. Why do we need long-term visibility? It's to make fair decisions. What kind of decisions? Like enable this long-term visibility. A few examples. First of all, a supplier selection. If we have a reliable and solid forecast for chemical materials for the client horizon of three to five years, we will be able to select the right suppliers considering how much amount they're able to source.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729145712179,"end_time":1729145790254,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Also, stock level optimization. It allows us to set the right stock level, avoiding shortages or overstocking, reducing unnecessary expenses. Another point, another aspect that this long-term visibility give us is the contract negotiation. If we are able to know, to estimate with a good accuracy how much chemicals we're going to consume in the next three to five years, we're able to negotiate the contract because we know the exact or very close to the exact amount that we will require and when.\n\n Okay. And finally, considering all these contract negotiations, supplier selection, and so on, we can create a better budget allocation, okay? So, I have covered, as I said, if we have a good input from the demand planning process, we're able to generate a good inventory planning, and a good supply planning."},{"start_time":1729145795298,"end_time":1729145999990,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"So, here we have a second look at the entire process. We have seen this before, but we're going to focus here now in the chemicals part of the process. So, the processes start with the materials consumption with the integration of the materials a consumption history, okay? So, here we're going to integrate all the different sources of consumption. So, there will be a technical session to identify these different sources of consumption.\n\n What are these reservations, work orders? We need to define that in detail, okay? After that, it's not healing for detail, but we will see it in more detail, we will have the demand segmentation for effective planning. As we also have seen, the segmentation allows us, it gives us the chance to do a more effective planning of using the time of the planners in a more effective way, focusing on the key products and let the system do the rest.\n\n Or they may be not relevant, not critical or more easy to forecast materials, right? Then we jump into the next box, which is the statistical forecast or statistical forecasting, which includes two steps. The pre-processing, which is the cleaning of outliers. We will cover that in detail. And of course, the the statistical part where we're going to run multiple algorithms to determine which one is better for each one of the combinations.\n\n Once we have this forecast, this demand forecast for the next three to five years, we can continue to the collaboration. We understand that in this case for chemicals, we have an input from two different teams. The first ones is the production team, and the second one is the inventory team, inventory controllers. Here we need to define rules to check which one has the priority. And of course, after we finish this process a few times, we will be able to measure the difference accuracy achieved in each one of the levels.\n\n And see where do we add more value and where is the contribution, the collaboration of the planners more relevant, where it adds more value. Finally, this output, of course, will serve as an input for inventory to determine the inventory policies for this type of materials and also for the supply planning where at the end of the process we'll generate purchase requisition, stock transfer requisition if needed, and with that we can have a total cost for the plan.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729146008175,"end_time":1729146137033,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Okay, so from a process perspective. So how, um. The way it starts is that system from, uh, on a weekly basis will gather the historical consumption. Uh, the inventory planner on a quarterly basis will then review the demand pattern. Um. We're saying quarterly, right? Because it's the band pattern is not going to change on a weekly basis. Then after that system will then generate the demand segmentation, which the inventory planner will review.\n\n Those segmentations are yet to be determined, so we have, based on our discussion, we have a lot of material classifications, and now in the system, we have to define those material in order for the system to recognize and do the segmentation. After that, will then review any outliers. So if there's any spike on the demand, we'll review it. We'll clean the data. And then we move on to forecasting, right?\n\n So the inventory plan will then run the forecast based on the historical consumption. We'll analyze it, and then you can see here when the inventory plan analyzes the forecast, forecast. There's an input of from the production planner. Just the manual demand. So to, uh, questions point we will have two figures right is the forecast from historic consumption as well as the manual demand from the production planner.\n\n There are any adjustments that the inventory planner needs to do. It will do them. Well, then finally, to finalize the demand plan. Once everyone is on board with that plan, we run that job to release it for the next phase, which is the inventory planning and supply planning."},{"start_time":1729146140095,"end_time":1729146141296,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Are there any questions?"},{"start_time":1729146143198,"end_time":1729146164602,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"I think, you know, this is not production planner, maybe maintenance planner, because I don't I don't think we are buying, you know, production planners are maybe more for the finished goods, right?

We can integrate additional data if required, if it adds any value to the analysis.\n\n But the main input is the actual consumption because this is going to be the main input to the forecasting process.

This is a a key part because it will allow us to be more efficient in the forecasting process, okay?\n\n So here we have different patterns, okay? Let's say we have, it was mentioned the company, the production plan of the company varies a lot. So analyzing historical data, it will allow us to identify what is the pattern. We can have here, we're having a blue square showing a trend pattern. So for example, certain material the consumption of certain material is growing each month by month. So the system will recognize that.\n\n Or as we can see here in this seasonal pattern, maybe because of the weather, of the different temperatures throughout the year, we're consuming more of certain chemicals during the summer or during the winter, et cetera. So the system will identify that and then will give us, will turn a report saying, okay, this material in this plan follows this pattern. Here we have an example of the result that the system gives.\n\n Continuous with trend, continuous with seasonality and trend, where the system allow us to save this information and then use it later to use system, sorry, algorithms that address this specific pattern. For example, if we have a continuous pattern, there's no need to run an intermittent model or there's no need to run a model that includes trend or seasonality. Why we need this? Because AdNod have plenty of records, plenty of combinations, so we want to use first the most suitable model, each combination and then we want to be efficient.\n\n We don't want to run everything for everything because it will take a lot of time.

This is more like a an open discussion, but first, we need to understand why we need the segmentation, why it adds value.

So the question is, in which as a user. So any segmentation will allow to identify where the user's input adds more value.\n\n For example, here we are presenting your own segmentation that, of course, it is used for that purpose.

This is an important part. I think we have covered this in in another session, but this is, I think is going to be very important for chemicals because they have a more stable consumption over time. So let's look at these two graphs, these two charts we have here. So let's assume, for example, for the top image, we have a very continuous consumption of certain chemicals, and then all of a sudden we have a peak.\n\n Consumption and then we go back to the continuous stable consumption. This could be due to several reasons. This could be maybe just a typo, someone put up a number and nobody noticed. This could be maybe, I don't know, any very exceptional situation. Probably you know better than me. So if we want to take, if we want to use this historical information as an input to generate a we need to clean this exceptional data.\n\n Why? Because it's not something we can predict. It's not something that will, it's very unlikely that this will repeat in the future. So the system identify, well, it has, I'm not going to cover the different algorithms that the system uses to identify this outlier, but the point is that the system identified this point and what it does, it corrects. It corrects based on a rule. We can maybe just indicate, look, you have a peak or a barrier, a layer can be upper or a lower layer, but the thing is that system will say, look, this data here, it's out of the rule, it's exceptional.\n\n We can define, as I said, a rule to replace it, maybe with an average, with an upper or lower limit, or we can just highlight it as an alert. That's it. The user can then make a decision if they want to keep it because they think it is something that maybe will happen in the future or they can replace it by any value they think is better. But for this image, for the top image, it's very clear that we have a downlier because the pattern is very clear.\n\n Continuous pattern around 100 then all of a sudden we have something very close to 500. But in the below image, it's something different. We have something that we can see is more of a seasonal pattern. Let's assume that during summers, we need to use maybe for the temperature some specific chemical. So the question is, are these peaks outliers? The answer is no, it's not. Just a seasonal behavior.\n\n It's a seasonal pattern that has peaks in the summer. So we don't want to replace them. We want to keep them. Why? Because we want to predict this behavior to the future. So good thing is that the system is able, using material learning, to recognize this pattern. The system is able to say, no, this is not an outlier. It's not an exceptional situation. It's just a seasonal and so the system will generate any other or will recommend any replacement for these values, okay?\n\n Now, I'll let you with my colleague Hector."},{"start_time":1729150739501,"end_time":1729150984473,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Okay, let me share the screen. Just want to step back. I don't want to enter right away to a statistical forecast. Let me show you a quick demo of what Bastian was showing you there. For those of you that haven't seen this yet, this is IVP. This is a planning view. The planning view is not different to the Excel spreadsheet that you are using today. The big difference is that this is connected to the cloud.\n\n So all the information that you are seeing here is connected to a remote server that is having all the information of your model. That means that you can decide want to see you, you don't need to bring all the information from chemicals or from your company, you can bring only the category that you want to check right now and that for sure will make that this is much faster than a spreadsheet that has thousands of combinations I guess.\n\n So the main things that you will find on this planning view is you have the key figures, that is information that you will have on the system depending on the time, inputs, outputs, whatever information we have in the middle as well is going to be a key figure and we have numbers on every period. Then you also will have hierarchies or attributes that we call on the system that are defining what is your plan, what is your material, the segmentation that Bastian was saying, for example, if this is a continuous pattern in termite, this is generating the system.\n\n Sorry, is there any question? Sorry, sorry, no questions. Okay, then additional hierarchies that are related to the materials or the plans, I don't know, for example, the company, so you can use this information to bring additional information on the planning view or maybe for filtering or maybe for consolidating the information, you can use these hierarchies and so on. And lastly, you have also the time that you can see this on most buckets, but you also can see it by week, by quarter, by year, or by whatever aggregation that you want, like semester, I don't know.\n\n We can do that as well. So that's just a quick introduction. Sync on this like a pivot table, whatever you see here is something that you can edit. You can edit from the horizon, the timing, the level of detail, you see information, the hierarchies, the key figures that you're seeing, if you want to see on rows, on columns, filters, and even you can configure some alerts that are going to highlight some exceptions that we want to show you right now.\n\n So that's a very, very quick introduction of AVP. Just to highlight what Bastian showed before, segmentation is generated automatically on the system. Indeed, based on the same rules that you are applying today, we can do it on the system and generate the ABC for example are the BEV we are also trying to we are seeing I think that we are going to do that as well it's a little bit more complicated but also can be done and this is machine learning that the system can identify it automatically what is the pattern of this material that I guess in most of the cases for you is going to be continuous but if you have some slow movers that are intermittent it's also going to identify okay then related to data cleansing.\n\n Bastian was explaining one example in which you have like a very high peak and the system is correcting. Let me show how this can be done here on IDP. You have the actual usage material that is historical consumption and you want to find out what are the outliers, the exceptions that probably are going to repeat but not on the same period, not on the same materials maybe. Is very highly unpredictable as Bastian was saying.\n\n So the system can identify it, you can see right away that you have a different color. Let me make it bigger just in case."},{"start_time":1729150991358,"end_time":1729151182864,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"So it's a different color so automatically it's telling you just by seeing the numbers that this is an exception and then the system can propose as well. So you have an OLAI correction that is be done automatically and it's trying to smooth the value so you see some some value that is making more sense probably is an average something like that. If this is seasonal it will try to accommodate to the high numbers or the low numbers that you have in that period but it's trying to smooth and to give you a more normal number let's say.\n\n Then if you want also you can apply a manual correction but it's always a possibility so So if you say, no, this number is too low, let's put 100, you can just override the number and you can get that number below. That is the final number that you see here. Let me hide this. And you see it there. So this is an important feature that you need to understand. Is always proposing, but the final number is coming from the planner.\n\n It's what you say. You are the owner of the number. The system is going to give you only proposals override. Okay, that's it. Let me go to the presentation and go with the statistical forecast. If you're having any questions, just interrupt me. I'm not sure if I can see when you raise a hand, so just interrupt please. Okay, so the statistical forecast. As we are mentioning, the idea of the statistical forecast is trying to see the historical patterns and replicate that in the future.\n\n So the basic idea is that you will find some repetitive pattern, right? The system automatically, with the many algorithms that it has, will identify it and will extrapolate this behavior to the future. That is basic statistical forecasting. For sure, there is many nuances and differences between the different algorithms, but this is a very easy way to understand what we are doing here so as we were mentioning before we have many things that defines the pattern like the baseline so you are you are consuming in the order of 10 or 100 or thousands I don't know depending on the unit of measure for sure that so that is the base number like the average right but there also can be intermittency so if you are not selling on any period or if you are selling on any period you have continued or intermittent demand, then you have trend.\n\n So if the system captures that historically you are increasing constantly your consumption or otherwise you are decreasing it, you also can capture that by statistical models. And seasonality, as Sebastian was mentioning. If you have in winter for the temperature, maybe you are using more of a chemical or the other way around, it's also going to detect this high consumption or low consumption, depending on the time of the year, because it's going to be a repetitive pattern that we see on the history.\n\n Okay, so that's in a nutshell the statistical forecast."},{"start_time":1729151183845,"end_time":1729151214977,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Oh, wait a minute, sir. Yeah. In the trend, is there a facility to add a percentage by the user who is planning? Yeah, for sure. So you can give input percentage saying that 5% on increased trend or 10% increase and so that the quantities are accordingly forecasted. Yeah, that's one thing. Second thing in seasonality. Is there any input parameter where user can specify?"},{"start_time":1729151214997,"end_time":1729151220001,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Do you have an example?"},{"start_time":1729151220602,"end_time":1729151226886,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"There are some chemicals which might be consumed more during the winter season.

Can the user say, okay, here on this specific months, there can be an event. We can highlight that in the past. So in the past, we can say these are the months in which this is happening. In the future, these are the months and this is when you have an item. This is more useful when this pattern, like this high consumption are not happening on the same period.\n\n But are related to the same reason, you know? I don't know. For example, one very good example is Ramadan. This is not affecting for sure. I don't know if this is affecting at all, but Ramadan is not happening on the same month every year. So if you want to specify the dates by the user, great. But if this is happening on December every year, you should expect that the system is going to capture it automatically.\n\n So when it's very regular, the system should be able to capture it. If this is a date that is moving, but it's the same event that is affecting the consumption, then we can specify it by the user."},{"start_time":1729151295968,"end_time":1729151300851,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"So there will be a seasonality input date facility while planning, starting date and end date."},{"start_time":1729151301952,"end_time":1729151314469,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Yeah, let's see if it's necessary.

Then when we have the supply plan, we want to make sure that we are not double counting. So yes, we need to do a kind of forecast consumption to avoid to use the same need twice, you know, because you already have the reservation and we are creating a forecast for So to avoid double continuous supply planning, we need to take care of that."},{"start_time":1729151369837,"end_time":1729151374500,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1729151375241,"end_time":1729151377843,"speaker":{"name":"Aboobacker M.

All right, perfect. Let's continue. So on AAP, you have many algorithms that you don't need to understand them. You need to understand what they are able to do, right? You have from very simple algorithms like the simple average, this is just an average, but in many cases is going to be the best forecast. And you have very advanced algorithms like the running boosting decision trees, that is machine learning, automatic exponential smoothing, also machine learning, auto-anima, and so on.\n\n So the idea is that many of them are going to, all of them are going to have different capabilities. Some of them are going to be specific for intermittency. All orders are going to be specific for continuous demand and others are able to capture trend and seasonality and so on. So a first layer of decision, because you are going to run many of them at the same time, that is what you're going to do.\n\n And the system is going to decide what is the best one. This is going not to happen in general, it's going to happen specifically for any material and plant combination. So for every combination, you are going to have maybe a algorithm. The system is going to do for you that optimization of deciding what is the best way to forecast this, what is the best fit algorithm, that is the keyword fit. So that's the basic idea.\n\n The first layer of deciding what is going to be the best forecast is the demand pattern recognition. As Bastian was clearly saying before, if you have intermittent demand then you are not going to spend time trying to use the because it's not going to give you a good number. So you only use automatically a system, the models are able to replicate that behavior. And between the models that are able to replicate that behavior, the system will calculate that error measure, right?\n\n This is part of the machine learning capabilities. And based on the fit to the actuals, to the historical numbers, it's going to decide what is the one that is reproducing better the behavior of that particular combination material plant so then it will decide on that one and will replicate for the future so all that I'm explaining is just for you to have an idea but the system is going to do it automatically you don't need to think anything here it's just something that is happening in the background all right so this is very important because when I tell you the system is very simple.\n\n It's like just two lines and you don't know what is happening behind. It's important to understand that it's a lot happening behind. It's just that we are not taking any decision there. So here you have the actuals. After you do the data cleansing, remember that the system will detect outliers, will propose you, you can override it. Whenever the actuals are cleansed, you can use it for the statistical forecast.\n\n This is a job that we can schedule. Here you have it, statistical forecasting. You have some parameters that you need to fill. Usually on the projects we left all this by default so you don't need to worry on the detail level because that is a definition or the forecast model that is a definition. So you just run it, it's just press a button and run the forecast and whenever this is run you will see the update numbers on this line, forecast usage of materials.\n\n So in this line it will propose you a, sorry for that, the statistical forecast that you can, as we were saying, you can review it. So that is why we are pushing a lot with segmentation, with to understand what are the critical ones for you because I think that you have too many combinations and if you want to review all of them, if you have all the people to review all of them, that's great. But if you don't, then the idea is that you focus on the important ones and in the important ones, you can do whatever, what we were doing before.\n\n Like if you want to write the number, you can do it. As if you were saying, for example, if you want to put a percentage, we can also configure something like that. This is very flexible. This is just an example of what you can do, but you can certainly, you can put like, instead of, for example if we overwrite this is going to happen if you add a delta like the difference like plus 20 this is going to happen this plus this it's a logic that we can put if you want to put a percentage here um just one minute if you want to put a percentage of increases this is going to happen so you will take this number and multiply by one plus this and you get the the number you need.\n\n So all these configurations are very possible. The idea is that we leave the system in the most friendly way for the user to input the numbers. So if you want to increase the trend, as we were saying, because the system doesn't know everything that is going to happen, then you can apply these corrections like percentages and you get right away the numbers that you need. That's the whole idea of the statistical forecast.\n\n It's not really complicated from the user perspective, but behind is many things are happening automatically. All right. Let me know if you have any questions, otherwise I will just jump right into the demo. A special case that we have is a new material interaction. I don't know if here is going to be the same case that we have many new materials or not. But the challenge for this kind of materials is that you don't have history.\n\n The big assumption of the forecast is that we check the history, we find a pattern, we replicate to the future. But what happens if you don't have it, the history in first place? So the common practice on demand planning, if you don't have the history for the new chemical that you are using, is that you need to have reference information, reference chemicals. So these chemicals are maybe in the same context, maybe they are very similar, maybe you are using it on another plant, but the usage is going to be fairly the same.\n\n So you can base your demand, it's going to be an assumption for sure, but assumption is all that you can do when you don't have information, so you need to do it. And what we want to do here is to create like a fictitious history, like a dummy history for the new material. So in the case of this is very simple just to calculate like an average of course you can do a weighted average so you can do more power to the the ones that are more similar but the whole idea is to calculate the average of this and based on this new demand history you can create the forecast so once you calculate this average history let's say then the process is the same you continue the same process forecast then overriding the numbers and so on.\n\n So that once we do that incorporates to the process. What happens when we start having own history? So when we start having maybe some months of history, the problem is that two months still is not going to be enough. When we want to do a statistical forecast, usually we need three years, five years, years. The more we have, the better for the forecast. For sure, two months, unless the demand is pretty much stable and two months are very representative of what is going to happen, it's okay.\n\n But I guess in most of the cases, we need to have more history to be able to create a good statistical forecast. So what is going to happen here is that you will maintain the history that you created. So you have the reference materials, right? You created your history, the fictitious history. And once you start having your own history, you start using that instead of the reference materials, because now you have, of course, you want to use the history of the product, the material, sorry, that you are forecasting.\n\n And then with this made up history, composed history, let's say, you create the focus. Okay, so that's a good idea. Not really complicated. So it's going to be like this. On SAP, of course. Do you have a question?"},{"start_time":1729151903010,"end_time":1729151904992,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"No, no.

So for the new chemical introduction process, it's very similar to the new part that we've seen for proactive and preventative. With a new material introduction, then we need to follow our existing process to create the material in SAP. So once the material has been created in SAP, then we transfer the data to SAP IP. And this is where, because we don't have any consumption history, we assign a reference, if you want to, to generate demand.\n\n This then will create a demand segmentation based on the reference material. Now, since we are saying that most of the demand will come from the end user, we might not need to, and if there aren't any historical consumption, I'm assuming most of the case will be to take whatever input the end user has put in. And then from there we go into the demand plan for Amaro chemicals."},{"start_time":1729151990822,"end_time":1729152015201,"speaker":{"name":"Raghavendra Mithal (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"Here I have a question.
