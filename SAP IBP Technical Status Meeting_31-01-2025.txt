UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello, everyone. Yeah, good morning, Paula.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Hello, good morning. Yeah, I think let us wait for others to join. Yeah, perfect.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, hi, Annetta.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hey, everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Morning.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hi, Kunal. Hello, everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
looks like in another call. I think maybe we can start. Anandha, for Buruj, we have sent you an email, one for the scope of the plant to be considered for the integration that we are currently doing for the sandbox.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
Yeah, you mean to say the plant 3700 is what you are including, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, that's something Nishant needs to confirm. Because I know 3700 is Abu Dhabi or Ruwais. But we have this China CMP plant. And if that should be part, I'm not sure. So Nishant would be the right person to comment on this, guys. OK, OK, sure.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think Nishant today is on leave. So let us wait for his feedback. On Monday, he'll give us back.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But I remember he told me Nishant that only this plan, but better to confirm. You already sent an email, right? I saw that. The DI request I think Inshall already did for you guys. I am not sure what is the status of that. But he has requested for all the project team members.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because initially Tara has raised but it was rejected.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I see there is approval from while to proceed. Is the approval from while sufficient?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Approval from while is also fine. See what has happened.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's a similar request which Tara was doing. Nishant has initiated the similar video instead of us doing so it will automatically go for his line manager for approval and on top of that he has sent an email you know to align with those guys so that is the mail you are sending.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Now there is a separate email which Sara has initiated which has While. For approval and while.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah process and where we do we need support yeah for the SDD currently we are working on mitigating the risk that is related to the certificate based SNC in which we need to enable so I think Sagar has already provided a steps which needs to be performed by Raghav from SAP CS team so maybe in the second half call will be set up by Mustafa to take Yeah, so I have requested SAP support also, like

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
if they can join the call and just validate. I mean, they have already given the steps, and I provided the same to Raghav. But the request is like if SAP team is available, and in case any issues come, then they can check on the call and close them. So I requested, so Paola, if you can help Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I already requested.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. OK.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So Paula, considering that now the STD is conditionally approved, we need to make sure that these two risks are mitigated. If not mitigated, then it will impact the goal life of our project. And we are, this SNC point, we've been discussing that it's like two and four communication So if SAP can join on the call, probably in a meeting or two, we'll be able to close the point for all so that we can focus on the built-rated activity, because this is taking a lot of time from our integration consultant to resolve this one specific point, which has been open for a while.

 So I would request support from you, Paul, on this.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Maybe let me comment on this, that we are working only with the incident and, you know, standard support. Another option, I mean, would be to ask some consultant, SAP consultant from your max attention contract to work on with you on this setup.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We can support on that.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I can take my management approval also.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
But exactly. I mean, you know, the setup is really taking a lot of time. So I was thinking that to speed up, we can eventually also consider this option, because at the moment, I mean, we are working only with the incident and, you know, it's a normal incident management.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I understand. You know, this project is very...

ROSSI, PAOLA:
No, exactly. So maybe we can even think for the follow up activity to consider the support of some max attention days to help you on the setup.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is my point. OK. So Khalid, what needs to be done to initiate what Paula is asking for?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So I don't You are aware of this premium engagement, right? We can utilize from there, right? Who's approval will finally allow us?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, we can utilize. Yes, the premium engagement support, but but the I mean the first preference we should give it for the you know the product support.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so then guys, when do you think would be the time for us to start this engagement because we've been trying it for a while now it's taking a lot of time for your team as well as our team

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
and we would like to make sure that we focus on other integration related activities as well so if you can guide us yeah yeah so Khalid you can initiate this discussion with SIGDAM and then you know she will internally discuss with the relevant teams in SAP and she will come back with the proposal like this will consume you know so many days a week or two weeks so she'll give you the proposal then we will take the approval from ADNOC and we can proceed with the engagement but Rahul engagement will take time and you know because she has to find the right candidate for this.

 Activity so it it might take time sometime.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Generally how much time it takes if we initiate now?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It depends, you know if if it is a common activity then you know he she could easily find the candidate. Otherwise if this is a unique thing and only specialized are there, then this will take time.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So is there any way Paola can help us identify or expedite the process of identifying the right person who can support from SAP?

ROSSI, PAOLA:
I don't know, let me try to reach them this morning so I can start the discussion with her and just on my, let me say, I will go in parallel also reaching the our expert working in the incident, but let's think maybe also for the future critical activities to ask and help to our SAP expert that can work together with you in the most critical activities. So we are more quick during the setup and integration, you know, Yeah.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because the point is right now, whatever activity we are doing are getting are is integration with sandbox system. We have got the development access and will have to replicate everything for development and then we have multiple instances in development as well. So we we have to close the sandbox as soon as possible and start replicating the effort in development and we have both Buruj and AdNoc systems.

 So like there are four systems, to be integrated right now. So so I think Khalid we should initiate this process of getting a premium support while in parallel. We will definitely do continue work. But it will be a limited number of hours, right?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It won't be so you should keep on. Let's say engaging what we are doing right now and wherever like a very critical support is required, we will use that. Try to use that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, so Sagar, this is where we'll need help is to clearly specify where or for which activity out of all the activities where we need support so that we can close that specific point and then we'll be able to replicate it for the rest of the systems.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, so I believe now only two activities are pending. One is SNC and second is CIDS single sign-on. So SMC setup, I am positive, like whatever steps, again, like whatever SAP is recommending, I think if we try to perform that, that should resolve the issue, because we have completed all the activity from SMC. It's just some error which we are getting, and I think for that, we need SAP help. So they suggested just perform the steps again with changing some certificate details, So I have shared same like I am like if that works then I can see setup will close then only the pending item will be CIDS single

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
sign-on. So help me clarify this if single sign-on I think we have initiated for IBP as well so setting the single sign-on for CIDS will not be a technical challenge for us just to make sure we are on same page

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
will that be a correct assumption Sagar? Yes means I was not part during the IBP but yeah like,

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So we've already done it for IBP and the same would be replicated for a different system which is the CIDS system right. So I feel that would not be so which means which leaves only that this SNC based signing sign on for with certificate that's the current challenge and what you are saying is you feel confident about the current steps which means if if you're having meeting today and if someone from SAP joins to to resolve this then we may not need the premium support is what you are saying this would finish all the integration activities.



Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, that's my understanding.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
All right, which is a good news, which means Paula, let's continue with this approach. If you can help us with this incident support team to support this one time activity. And if we are able to resolve, then we may not need to go beyond the current support mechanism. But today, if we are not able to resolve today or maybe one more session may be required on Monday. If between today and Monday, if we are not able to resolve, then for sure, Sagar, we should immediately highlight this.

 I don't want this point to be dragging beyond a certain point. It should be closed either today or at the latest by Monday.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, I agree.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's fine. All right.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And Sagar, you are confirming that if we are able to do this, close this between today and Monday, then we'll be able to replicate all the steps what we done till now for development environment and the instances, multiple instances of development environment between AdNoc and Guruj, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. All right.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So hopefully, Paula, you'll be able to support us here and get a consultant attend our meeting. Sagar, is this meeting already planned?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, I requested SAP to provide the times by when I can send the schedule. But I believe they are working on USR, so once they are available, then they can share the time.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
I'm trying to contact the SAP expert assigned to understand when he can do a call, OK?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So yeah, Paula will appreciate if you can help us get this possible so that will send invite immediately. Sagar let's go ahead and send invite immediately once we get this confirmation so that the time is blocked for all the people to be available and hopefully we'll be able to close this issue today. Any other activities Sagar from a technical front where you need support other than what we have discussed?



Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, I think IBP data, IBP certificate-based is already done, and it's working correctly. So I think we are good. We have to, again, I mean, so we perform that activity for the one ERP agent. So now we have to, again, perform the same activity for Boro Chef agent. The steps will be same.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
All right. We'll talk separately, but Kaiser. We will once this activity is resolved, will need your support to work with us next week to finish the interface with development activity so that we can prioritize this and get complete activities for the development instances. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this add-on deployment we will finish it. This weekend itself. All right, all right. Yeah, maybe that will be not today, but tomorrow I guess. All right, all right.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So once one thing is add-on installment on S4 HANA, but then from an interface perspective, probably will have to create data stores for all the instances of SAP, right? Yeah, so need to do the activity on DSN CIDS site to make sure that we are integrating the development instances Yeah, so it it has to be done post the add-on deployment or it can work. It's not a prerequisite, right? Because add-on will ensure that data is getting extracted from S4, whereas the interface will ensure that the data extracted by add-on is pushed to the systems.



Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, OK, no problem. So next week we will work on this aspect.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
is to plan this activity and make sure the meeting invites and discussions are planned up front so that we can execute in a planned manner rather than doing it in an ad hoc manner one after another. So Kunal and Sagar, if we can put up a plan today during the day of what all steps we need to do in different systems in next week so that everyone is aligned and invites are sent so that we have plan approach to execute this activity next week.

 All right? All right. Now Khalid, on Buruj's side, I had a conversation with Anandha yesterday. So we understand Buruj is under process of refreshing their development servers. Also, there is an activity of kind of harmonization of multiple development servers into one development environment. So, unless this activity is completed, we will not be able to start Uruja activity on development side. So, as of now, this is something which is blocking us.

 I have requested Ananda's support to expedite as much as possible, but this is for your information and this is something which is at this point of time critical of nature, but let's hope that Ananda is able to push get this system access as soon as possible.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, noted. Yeah, you told me earlier as well. So Ananda, please, if you can at least prepone the development server which they want to start their activities on, that will be really appreciated. And if you want any support from us, from our management, from Feras, we are willing to do that as well.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
Yeah, I got that. I mean, as of now, we know we are putting all hands on desk to see how we can expedite it, and we are following it.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'll keep you posted.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. Thank you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, Sagar, then let's prioritize 1ERP activities next week till Burrut system is getting available for us. And if you are able to close 1ERP development related activities next week, in the following week, we can then work with Ananda to prioritize activities.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right. Okay, any other point?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We talked about the open issues, we talked about the plan for integration of rest of the activities. Any other point which needs to be discussed in this forum?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So the technical team have got access to the development system, right? To the project dynasty ER5 and ER6. Charm has been created as well. However, for the task, you need to coordinate with the hero. That's in the email, OK? And if you face any issue, you just let me know. And probably that should be good to go, right? Or any other thing which is pending, which is stopping you from starting the development activities.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think if we are able to get TR, then I think we'll be able to do this. Kunal, can you take this on priority to get this TR available? And quick question, Kaiser, for you implement or install this add-on, you would need this TR.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Probably you will need the charm details.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You can create the TR itself, right?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For add-on deployment, no, I don't need a TR or a charm.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
All right.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's good to know that it's an independent activity, which means Kunal, let's take this up internally to make sure that we have this TR available as soon as possible. Because once the add-on is installed over the weekend, then the technical team can start working on configuring the interfaces and making changes on S4 on a site. Thanks for this one, Khalid. Anything else from anyone? Paula, do you have any activities from an SAP perspective which we need to to consider and look at now that we are into build phase.



ROSSI, PAOLA:
Let's speak in another more quiet moment. I want to focus today on reaching my expert and try to solve this blocking error. Let's take it for the next school.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Noted.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Alright, then I think we have discussed all the points we wanted to discuss. Anyone has any other point? Please feel free to add here. If not, then we can conclude up at all. Thank you, Tim. Thank you. Thank you everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Have a nice day. Bye bye. You. You Hey Kazer? Hello?
