We'll continue Tara on SDD, but at least we have some breathing space just to be able to continue. Now for the approval. If Raoul is still not in good shape, ping Hadi, Tara, because I don't want to do this.\n\n It gets stuck with me, the pinging. So confirming with Asma. So check with Hadi. I know he has a doctor appointment, but he should be available after. Maybe Hadi can double check with Raoul. If Raoul is not in a shape to send a reminder, then Hadi would do this. So try to do this the earliest, even though But Late because it's Friday, but at least it's first thing in the morning and as much inbox so we don't send it Monday and then it's it's too late.\n\n This way we will guarantee that you would see it Monday morning."},{"start_time":1735294208302,"end_time":1735294219836,"speaker":{"name":"Madhavan, Tara"},"words":"OK, OK and we have.

So I think Hadi is aware of this, so all the design documents plus the email from Isa plus the effort that was prepared between Kushbu and Rocio on the ad hoc effort versus KPMG. So yes, that's why should be sent. Now, if it's only a reminder or on team chat, because Hadi also has access to AdNoc, he can send it by team, on teams, but I'll let him and Raoul align so that we don't have too many people pinging her, just to be consistent.\n\n Okay. So you can reply on our collective group, Go SEM and KPMG, saying Hadi and Raoul I need to contact you to get closure on this US data so that they read it and based on it, you can have a chat or ping Hadi directly on WhatsApp to get an answer so that we don't."},{"start_time":1735294293844,"end_time":1735294311377,"speaker":{"name":"Madhavan, Tara"},"words":"This doesn't drag OK.

So what is the next step is something."},{"start_time":1735294311377,"end_time":1735294348531,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"So again, yes, the next step and that's why I want Hadi and Raul to be always in sync so you can help us and follow up. But one of them would be the person. So if Raul the action here is just like for wave one pinging asthma for this one is pinging asthma and the team that received the documents telling them team thank you for your support. We noticed some feedback or comments. We will assume that by Monday morning your comments, all your comments have been shared.\n\n Again, the push that we always have just to draw a line, OK?"},{"start_time":1735294348531,"end_time":1735294350370,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yeah, no.

I don't want to become the the bottleneck, especially since this should be synchronized between Raul and Hadi. Unfortunately, Raul is sick, but Hadi can cover this. This way, we have for both some push and closure. Kunal, the six document, or Kunal, Bastian and GoaCM team, document number, yeah, the six out of six for wave two, the tie-in, the last one for supply.\n\n Is it done?"},{"start_time":1735294388930,"end_time":1735294400954,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"I think it's almost done.

So there is no big gap between the first batch, the five documents out of six we sent, and this one. Otherwise, we will have a delay in approval.

No, that's what Tara is saying."},{"start_time":1735294430460,"end_time":1735294521724,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"So usually it's not approval, it's feedback. You remember what we've done with Wave 1? We get feedback based on it. Let's say no one had feedback or they had some comments. We reply, update the document and answer their feedback. And then based on it, we will say, OK, can we get your approval? Proceed. That's why I want Hadi or Raoul to push on that feedback. The deadline for the feedback was Thursday when Raoul sent those emails for at least five out of six or the documents sent.\n\n So how much traction? Honestly, I wouldn't know, but you can all access the documents and see. It might be a bit than That's why we wanted Raoul and Hadi to push saying guys will assume by Monday that if there is no feedback that this is okay. The usual cycle we went through before but now we're making it shorter. We gave them more time last time for feedback and then when we got the feedback we gave them a few days for approval.\n\n This one I would like between Monday, Tuesday to say okay guys we're closing this and we need the your formal approval. Which means also Kunal and the team, while working on firewall and the ZD in parallel, just check those comments on wave one. I think, Bastian, you can brief Arun and Vivek if they're not on the call. Sorry, again, I'm on my phone. Just to start checking the feedback and if there is fine tuning to be done or updates.\n\n So we work in parallel on this."},{"start_time":1735294521724,"end_time":1735294522442,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Make sense?"},{"start_time":1735294522442,"end_time":1735294522800,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Yes."},{"start_time":1735294524430,"end_time":1735294525236,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay, yeah."},{"start_time":1735294525236,"end_time":1735294547394,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Tara, can I let you align with Hadi so that you and him can take those actions this way or with one or all of the above?

The reason we need at least, Koushbo is also on leave, she'll be back Monday, or I don't know, but at least Raoul will be there, so that you can get this view of what deserves some attention in terms of changing some ways of working in S4.\n\n If you agree, team, then let's better move it till Monday, otherwise you can side and stay for today."},{"start_time":1735294638548,"end_time":1735294651517,"speaker":{"name":"Gusev, Nikita (UAE)"},"words":"Yeah, that's one aspect.

Yeah, which is a list that Raoul prepared with Khaled, which is the same list in a way. For the approval of the document. It might be a subset of not everyone. So yes, those core users, logically, whomever is reviewing documents, et cetera, is actually also being involved in the build to see whatever they approved being built. So yes, that's also another reason for Raul to be involved.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735294685227,"end_time":1735294704135,"speaker":{"name":"Gusev, Nikita (UAE)"},"words":"Okay, so let's give Raul some time to recover and I'll ask him for when would want to move this meeting.
