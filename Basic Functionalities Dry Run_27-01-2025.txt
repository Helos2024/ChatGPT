Rocio Minguillon:
Hi, Arun Basti, how are you?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hola, ¿qué tal? ¿Escuchan?

Bastian Osorio:
Hola, sí. Hola, Basti. Sorry, I was speaking. Just my mind didn't connect to English.

Rocio Minguillon:
It's early, it's Monday.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, give me a second.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yesterday I achieved the two certifications, so I'm officially a SIP project manager or whatever.

Bastian Osorio:
Congratulations, congratulations.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. That's very good. OK, Bill, we have time for that. Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
OK, so we change a little bit the presentation for today because we check that. Most of the details of the presentation that I didn't use anywhere where Diana details, so we needed to. To fix that. Yeah, I told Arun to fix them.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, I translated everything in English and then Arun was going to change the details, but I don't know how that ends.

Bastian Osorio:
So this is a presentation changed the date and today is 27th.

Arun Singh:
Sebastian, I already sent the updated presentation, I think on Saturday. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, that it had so many details from Diana.

Bastian Osorio:
No, no, no, I've updated it.

Arun Singh:
I've updated all the screenshots and everything. I don't know which file you are referring.

Bastian Osorio:
But because we want to go with more hands-on session, I think we change a little bit the approach. And we're going to make this very brief presentation and then jump directly to the system, OK? So for example, instead of set up connection, instead of just showing the images of how to do it, we'll show it in the system, okay? Yes, Tim.

Hector Palacios:
What you shared, that is a manual. It's a user guide. It's not something that we can use in the session. In the session, if you put that image, it's not something that you can drive the conversation. Instead of showing an image, it's better to show the system, right? So it doesn't make sense we change the whole thing.

Arun Singh:
Yeah, but actually also we need to have those content again. Because in case if a new joinee is introduced right in the team then he or she must have some kind of you know reference like apart from the video right so all the content has to be there you know in case a new member joins in AdNoc business okay so that was the intention because I have discussed with Rocio as well that we will have this content you know just a reference but we will just demonstrate it in the system more briefly.



Bastian Osorio:
But for this session, because it has to be hands-on, the idea is to just show this presentation very briefly and then jump into the system. So the way it's going of work, Hector Palacios and also Rahul will do a brief introduction and overview. I was thinking, Hector, that… Can I see that slide, the previous one? Sorry, this one, because this is where we are, then this is the agenda.

Rocio Minguillon:
The number five, number five. To read the number five.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Hector?

Bastian Osorio:
I believe this one should go after this because this is kind of the introduction. I mean, this will drive immediate questions. So if you start Over.

Rocio Minguillon:
I agree that the first thing that you should do is tell him what are they doing in that session.

Bastian Osorio:
Yes, and then you at the end.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This is the beginning of the presentation. I'm good.

Bastian Osorio:
So OK, this is where we are. Bye-bye. Sessions to Jenga. You Sessions.

Rocio Minguillon:
Team, quick question, because if not, we should. The users, I think that they already have a user, but do they have like a business role or a permission filter associated or?

Bastian Osorio:
No, I can, can you take that, Arun? Just assign them a business role like a basic, let's say, demand planner.

Arun Singh:
Okay, sure. But just one thing, Abhashan, like in this first session, right, it's just like a brief introduction of IDP, so only the demand planner will be involved or like even our inventory and supply planner will be there?

Bastian Osorio:
Everyone, but just the idea is to set you can set demand plan so they able to for example see master data or they able to open templates that that is the only thing they should be able to do okay

Arun Singh:
so like uh do they already have this rule aside or do I need to that's yeah yeah once we finish you can do it because we still have two hours to this session.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK. I just sent you the Excel with the users. So you know. OK, I'll take a look.

Arun Singh:
So if like all the users are there right from different business function, so not sure do we need to include Because this has to be more generic from the IBP user perspective.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, I believe Planet Workspaces, I mean, for the users that like more to work in the Fiori app, it's still a good use case.

Arun Singh:
No, no, no, slide number six, slide number six, I was saying, because you have all the business functions. So I don't know, like, I mean, because in this slide, they will keep on asking you know I don't know I believe in on a high level this is just a recall a summary of what is this project about

Bastian Osorio:
so they're gonna be made plenty of users that this is the first time they are present in this session so so I think it's great to have brief introduction. We shouldn't take more, hope, more than five minutes, five, ten minutes, if there are some questions, and then we jump into the system. So, okay, sessions, agenda, you can take these two, to Rocio. Take this one and this one, okay?

Rocio Minguillon:
Oh, you are, okay. It's just telling the agenda, basically.

Bastian Osorio:
This week is going to be focusing on MRO, demand planning, inventory planning, and because if you just say that, you're going to speak like, I don't know, 30 seconds, so you better tell the the whole introduction.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, yes, I will be happy to do it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you, thank you. Then Hector comes here.

Bastian Osorio:
Then you help them. I don't do to the setup connection and then I can jump into the Excel interface, and I will start showing them the master data, different planning views, and then Hector in the web interface. Is that clear?

Arun Singh:
Is there any question?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What about alerts?

Bastian Osorio:
I will show that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I will show.

Arun Singh:
OK, so you will be showing in Planner Workspace and then Analytics, Tabular Format, all these graphical charts and even the alerts, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Everything on Workspace.

Bastian Osorio:
OK. But I also can show some alerts. Yeah, let's see.

Arun Singh:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
But, of course, are way more detailed in the Planet workspace. I don't see the users on IVP, guys.

Hector Palacios:
I don't know if need to do anything else before?

Rocio Minguillon:
They are not created. Yeah, I don't see them, but

Hector Palacios:
Can you, can you, why don't you write to Kunal? No, no, but I don't see that they created this user for Pablo, for example.

Bastian Osorio:
No, no. That's what I'm saying. Send an email to Kunal or to Hali.

Hector Palacios:
No, but they are not doing this internally. It's our Fiamma.

Rocio Minguillon:
They should know how to do it. Pablo and the rest of the team and for me, I asked for example, Fiamma. Fiamma was the one who created it for everyone, internally in our team. But now Fiamma is not here. But it's very easy. The users. I mean, we can do it like weekly, but I thought that they were created because as you said, Hector, that it was full of users there. I thought that they were.

Bastian Osorio:
Do you have the emails of the users?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
Then it should be easy to create them, right?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, let's do that then.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I can't believe that.

Hector Palacios:
And Arun, you take it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The users. Can you create the users, Arun?

Rocio Minguillon:
Are you used to that? The one that you have shared, right?

Arun Singh:
The file that you shared with me? Yes, exactly those ones. So there are three tabs, which one should I refer?

Rocio Minguillon:
There are like AGC, focal points, common user, primary responsible.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The first one, the first slide, the first sheet.

Rocio Minguillon:
So for For the user ID, are they using the first letter of the name and then the surname? Can you check if there are other users created? What is the logic that they used to put the user ID?

Arun Singh:
Is this thing in your email ID? I can see mine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I'm just trying to find.

Arun Singh:
Is it for Russian? Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
is I use my email to log into. No, no, that's fine.

Arun Singh:
But your username defined is this way. So I'm just trying to see, like, for example, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, like the logic.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, I think the logic is like the first one.

Arun Singh:
But this is my email ID logic, OK? It is not that. OK, I don't know my email ID. So basically, I'm just trying to move. It is the same for everyone's cases.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, everyone has the first letter of the name. And can you see, like, AdMob users, if there's any? They have the IP... Can you go, like, from the upper... Can you go more, like... In the upper side of the screen. They have numbers as username.

Arun Singh:
Also, we should create the No, we should create them, I don't. But I don't see the Well, that is only useful for IVP and we are in QA, so it doesn't matter.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, let's put the first letter of the name and the surname as the username and business ID, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
There is another application. To create the users?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah, because this is just to create.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, we're going to use the upload to, that you have to upload the template, that is the easier. I don't know if... If you're used to that, but there I am.

Arun Singh:
Okay, I'll save for later.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, so one quick question. Should I also introduce the agenda? I didn't pay attention. Or only the calendar and where are we? The meeting agenda, you mean?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
I can start speaking and then you jump into the introduction or and what are the next steps. I think where we are, you need to clearly mention the user testing and UAT. This is an important thing, okay? That we will have, okay, I don't know, multiple user training sessions, and then we will have the UAT where we're gonna test all the different scenarios before going live. And on the top of that, we have six months of hypercurrency.

 Any issue, any doubt, and yeah, it should be addressed during that phase. And then the meeting decisions agenda is self-explanatory, right?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, it's just mentioning, yeah, okay.

Bastian Osorio:
And then Hector jumped into the introduction and overview, and once he's finished, we jump into the system. Sorry, yeah, into the connection settings. So once Hector finished, I don't want to speak. And once I don't finish, I jump into the explanation of the master data and planning views.

Rocio Minguillon:
Amazing. Can you upload the presentation here?

Bastian Osorio:
It's already uploaded. Share it in the chat?

Rocio Minguillon:
Here I find it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. Let me put it in the chat. Here you go. Thank you.

Rocio Minguillon:
Is there any doubt? Are the users created? No, they are not, but Arun is going to create it. Okay. Listen, you need to start on this application.

Bastian Osorio:
It's not maintain business user.

Hector Palacios:
You need to start on and maintain employees after you created them, but you can do it, I think, as a and you go to the other one.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, I will send you just in case you didn't do this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. Many times.

Rocio Minguillon:
It's in Spanish. OK. OK. Anything you need, don't ask me and I can help.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Hector Palacios:
Rusty, who's going to do the introduction at the end?

Bastian Osorio:
I'm gonna, I mean, you're gonna do the introduction and overview, but just the starting, like the introduction to the session, like, hello everyone, whatever, I'm gonna do it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
All right. And then you go to the introduction. Workspace.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. All right. Cool.

Rocio Minguillon:
If there's any doubt.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Nope.

Rocio Minguillon:
Should we show you with that? Not users. If we have, I don't have the meetings in my admin user, but I will ask that for anyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry.

Rocio Minguillon:
No, that I will join with the ad hoc email. No one complains.

Hector Palacios:
No, no, no, it's true.

Rocio Minguillon:
Ah, OK. OK, thank you. No, that's here. All right, team.

Hector Palacios:
See you. Bye.

Arun Singh:
