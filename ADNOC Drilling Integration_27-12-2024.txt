I agree. But the way to achieve that is first showing that we understood the requirement. And this is going to be by showing this what this great work that Hadoop has made. Okay, so let's show it to Bigness, make sure everything is being addressed, then show with them, and then from then we can start from scratch. Okay guys, we have something we can work on, let's keep working together and get the alignment, as you said, with Asmy and with Firas.\n\n But I will take a note of that. It's extremely important to be committed to this project. Yeah, I will try to meet, let's try to schedule a meeting for Monday or Tuesday next week with Bignesh, and then from there, as soon as possible, with the rest of the drilling team."},{"start_time":1735303576706,"end_time":1735303599994,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"But it's on our side to raise the alert to GPMG, to Navani, to whoever, because we have a change management team, so they need to know this.

The core team should be committed to the project and they need to defend the project against the end-user because the end-users are going to be the ones that have the resistance to change, right?
