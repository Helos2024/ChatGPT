So for the calculation of the inventory policies, the best practice is to only use corrective maintenance. Why? Source of uncertainty. Your preventive plans are not, they don't have uncertainty. Why? Because they will happen for sure. Let's say you will change the filters, the seals of a pump in the next month. If you plan that activity, that will happen and the amount of seals that you will change is defined, let's say five seals.\n\n Whereas that is preventive maintenance and that you shouldn't have in theory, of course, safety stock for that because you know the exact amount that you need. Whereas for corrective maintenance is something that you are trying to estimate when the equipment will fail and you will have to replace spare parts. So in this case, of course, you estimate, okay, there is a chance that the equipment and I need to change these pieces but that of course doesn't have a 100% accuracy so you need to have a safety stock reorder point for that so that's why the only source for inventory policy is the corrective maintenance.\n\n Having said that I understand that in your cases sometimes the preventive maintenance you find, I mean, it's not, probably you can give us more information about this, but it's not as planned as the system is designed. I don't know if you get what I'm trying to say. You don't know for sure how many pieces you will change in a preventive maintenance. So if you think it in that way, of course it is attached to either have uncertainty and it should be up to the inventory calculation.\n\n The impact of that will be an increased inventory policy. So, we need to assess the impact of that of including the preventive maintenance plan, the preventive maintenance consumption forecast in the inventory calculation because we don't want to end up with an increased inventory policy due to again to included the preventing plan as a source of uncertainty. Conclude this point, you know, it's a very valid point because you don't know what is my data current data.\n\n"},{"start_time":1733997302352,"end_time":1733997326659,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"So keep this point open.

Anything anyway is going to happen. So but we cannot simply say that this will increase service inventory because you are defining different risk scores and based upon the segmentation and we are putting different service level for each risk score.\n\n So for example, if you say business critical material is very important, which means you cannot afford to keep the plant down because of business critical level, which means you will end up having inventory for business critical because it will have a highest risk score. But if something which is not critical, something which is not important, then you will not keep a lot of inventory because so the service level will also be less.\n\n So this is something with the data we'll have to check how the result is coming and then decide service level."},{"start_time":1734001122662,"end_time":1734001135390,"speaker":{"name":"Aboobacker M.

So that, of course, is consensual.\n\n It's very hard, like, in numbers to determine that number. So at the end, it's more an empirical calculation. So we need to test, again, with data.

This was a point from the earlier discussion where the recommendation was to use MRP type for some materials in MRP and the external planning for IVP plant material but we have agreed that everything would be planned in IVP.

Of this document so that we can get official approval to start building the system. So as part of the Adnox procedures for any project, the BRD, BPD has to be signed off by the users so that we can start building the system. That's one step. Second is data to be available in the Adnox system to build it. So right now, the first step which we are reviewing this document, so hopefully after we make all these changes, we will have the approval from you to proceed in building.\n\n The second step of interface is being worked upon separately by team where it is with AdNoc for opening the firewall ports so that system interface configuration work can be completed. So based upon these two inputs, So we will start working and we will get back to you on when we can give you the first cut of the solution. Also, there is this prioritization request come from AdNoc leadership, where the request is to initiate prioritized drilling business work.\n\n So that is being reviewed with the AdNoc leadership.

So probably we'll get back to the team, reach out with you and identify the sample metals for each agency so that respective planner from the respective agency can evaluate based on his materials and get his confidence on the improvement which is proposed by the tool.\n\n So any other question from anyone? Then if there are no further questions, the next step would be for us to make the changes. Confirm this changes to the team and then based upon if team is OK, then I'm not.
