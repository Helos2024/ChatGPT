So he said that you also need to come up with a mitigation plan if it is finally identified as a risk from SDD which is what which is what one is the authentication mechanism in CIDS so currently it's a basic username and password that he's saying that is not a secure way of authentication and it is having a risk associated with this and it is not compliant with the ADNOC security policy requirement.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735049016353,"end_time":1735049026310,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"That's not our issue.

We can copy the rest of the team, saying we had a call today What's his name? Whatever highlighted two points. You can copy this this guy But you say at this point We need a conditional approval ASAP.\n\n However, it seems that this will not happen. Anyway, I'll let you drop after the or Write the email Raul and Kunal. This is a must for tonight So that feel because I was checking with Firas before I left on the other guy Modar and he said he pinged him, he didn't reply, hopefully tomorrow morning. So by tomorrow morning when he was, he's checking on the other security, the risk guy, sorry, the security, we need to have his email, this email in his inbox saying we have another risk.\n\n Now, based on it, we can forward again or send another email or using that same email, ask Paola and the SAP team to help.

I'm fed up with all of those delays. So we'll send this email, so this guy would see that we're sent to SAP, but after that we'll send, as you said, based on it, a forward or a reply to Firas saying, Firas, we need your help. If this doesn't get approved, it means we will not proceed, so we need your help with this conditional approval.\n\n Copy everyone that is involved, especially Tara, Hadi, and myself, so we can chase Firas There is always something, and that's not our issue with those delays. If this is more delay, then let the month be a month and a half. I mean, we're preparing the change request. I don't care.

Let's take it from there. On Friday, we have this drilling orientation or education session from QAnon. Anything else, team? Other points, other burning things. I think change management team, that point related to award has been raised. You were on the call or some of you were on the call. We will support Asma, but without impacting our original plan.\n\n We don't have capacity. I talked to Firas before and after. He's supportive. So whatever has an impact on our capacity or timeline, he will And also, actually, Raoul and Tara, we need also to book, and please, Tara, add this to, or it's already there on our issue list, discussion regarding PMO for baseline. So, how he report? He said, Firas said, he doesn't want to to hide the delay, but how he show it, how he shows it for January 9 versus after, I mean Muhaddim, is something that can be discussed, but we need half an hour with Firas.\n\n So this is something that I would like Hadi to be involved in, so if you'd like to book it on Thursday or Friday, I can attend, but as optional. I don't want to drive this, this is something that I would leave to But please make sure it's it's happening. OK, and the same for Friday, right? Yes, yes, yes, just as an alignment with Firas. We got this request. Please, what do you think you would need to brief Hadi and then he would talk to Firas and you definitely to align on.\n\n OK, and the same for the benefits. Presentation. At this point, we need some time, but if there is something we need Firas's input, let's use that call also.

Let's stick to this level of detail. Yes, so You can review check if there is anything that is basically over promising, but I think the quick answer is yes Let's give her feedback on this now.\n\n There is another video later on to be prepared And she was asking for some study or benchmark. I suggested that she uses the business case for benchmarks because at this point there is nothing we can prepare. Benchmarks are very dangerous because all improvements are related to where you stand, your baseline today. If your current process is actually in good situation, benchmark doesn't match. So those benchmarks are relative to a specific or these are targets versus the baseline they have.\n\n So I don't want to get into this study. They need to do this. They had a business case. So at least for now, let's help her in that form, the template that she sent and whatever she would ask for, let's understand what's needed. But I got a promise or I on the call today, Firas's presence, and to her, that we're ready to help, provided this will not impact our already planned change management activities and project activities.\n\n So if it's on the side, fine, but not another activity or track that we never planned for.

If we do not have more detailed examples or scenario or use case, and this is for the rest of the team, especially Bastian, Rocio, Sebastian, Hector, whoever is on call, we discussed this, if we don't have those as part of a use case document and indirectly the training, because the training and UAT will be based on those.\n\n We will struggle with the users when we start involving them for unit tests or SIT. So we need to articulate this. We just need a meeting to start thinking. Definitely we have Khushboo who can help on those, being that person that now can hold the pen on it. She would need input from different people. But we need to make sure we have those. Otherwise, we cannot manage those users.
