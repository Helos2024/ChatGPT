Didn't join. Guys. Anyone saw the slide that Bastian and the team prepared for the drilling release? I'm not very clear on it. It's I think we should do it after the huddle, but I would need bassin or whomever worked on it. I think after we created the draft kushboo, which one role they edited and created the rest, correct? Right team? Yes. Yes, Mama. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.\n\n Joins. So there are two burning points that I would like us to discuss and then we'll take actions. One is related to drilling data. This back and forth without the Latif sent. What data they think they shared, but also some data specific to drilling. And again, the never ending story. They're concerned that we don't know drilling enough, which means that's why we're not able to ask for the right fields, etc.\n\n I'll tackle this in a minute. That's one topic. The second is, Bassem, now that you joined, the slide that you created for the prerequisite of drilling release, I would need probably 10-15 minutes. Maybe we'll do it immediately after Huddle walkthrough to understand it, or if we finish the first topic quick enough. Because for the steel core, it's good, but I would like to understand it better. Right now, I'm not able to talk smartly enough about it.\n\n So these are very burning points. But before we take the whole call on this, anything else is pressing around the table again critical so that we do not have to delay it till tomorrow. It will not explode. At least before before anyone shares, I can update you. The SDD is halfway that we still have two or three approvals, but we're pushing. Firas is supporting. We do have a couple of acceptance. Maybe you can tell us what's working or not.\n\n And then the rest, I think these are the two burning points we need to discuss.

Maybe I have a gut feeling that drilling might be related to this hiccup. I hope I'm wrong. But yes, a summary because we need to. Today the emails from Khaled was based on the morning discussion. We told them, please, you need to send a reminder after Rahul's email because also they should take you more seriously than us. But in the tomorrow we're reporting on the progress so if anyone would say um we didn't know we're making sure that we sent reminders tomorrow by midday if no progress then we're going to expose or just highlight one document at a time who's not approving let them answer to the STLCO.\n\n Until then let's share that summary. Okay so this is where we are now let me explain in two minutes the drilling issue. And there are multiple things we need to do to fix this. Part of it is related to what Bastian said about understanding the drilling area, because this is not going to go away. As we go more into the build, the solution, as we all know, and even the scope of work, is always saying MRO drilling, drilling MRO.\n\n So even if the number of items for drilling is less, it's the nature of it. But it's a solution for both business lines. That's why we always say MRO business line and drilling chemicals is under MRO. So they have this nagging feeling that when there is something that we're not able to detail further, that it's because of our lack of understanding of drilling. Now, Bastian, in your reply now, I have sort of a semi-confirmation that yes, the drilling topic is complicated and we're not, let's say, fully well-versed in it because this is a bit ad hoc specific.\n\n Now, this will come back and hurt us later. One thing, I discussed it with Mo Fakhoury, we can ask Hinaan, our partner in supply chain who some of you have met and he's a drilling, basically used to work on sites, to give us an orientation. What I expect or would request from you around the table, whomever will be interested, especially discussing this topic with the client, is come with some questions that you'd like to know, but Kenan will help us.\n\n I have a call with him tomorrow or Friday with this ABC of drilling. We have this comfort with this topic, just like we're comfortable when we're talking MRO and maintenance, or more comfortable when we're talking maintenance topics. This is what I can do from my side, other than also Kinan has hours or days on the project, he can join, but he cannot be in every discussion. And what happened during any of those, like this email about data, this issue now today triggered because we sent templates and our templates were part of this was sent before in September.\n\n So they thought we didn't understand the terminology of drilling versus the IBP naming. That's one. Two, in those templates, we missed some drilling-specific critical fields, and they thought, ah, so it seems you're still treating the drilling like a morrow, which means the solution will not be good enough for drilling. I'm giving everyone the context, but specifically for the technical and functional team, because I had a couple of calls with Khaled and the rest of the team.\n\n So addressing this comfort, this is with Kinan. Fixing this, and it will take time. I requested a meeting with Khaled and Moheddin, sorry, Abdul Latif, just to address this and figure out how to proceed their concern. I think from our side, we can minimize or manage the risk through what I sent regarding data. There are two challenges with the data templates we have, or two areas to be fixed. They send data in September.\n\n Question, you mentioned that they're expecting us to do this. I don't think it's zero or one. It will be a joint effort. We'll tell them, guys, this is what IBP expects. And in terminology of drilling, this is it. Help us understand where this is in your data. Now, Abdul Latif, on purpose in the email, which I put on the chat, said we had multiple sessions on this. So he's in a way trying to make a point, guys, we had multiple sessions, we shared the data.\n\n Logically, you should even immediately from the template that you sent spot 50%, 60%, maybe not everything, and you might have some questions, but you sent it empty, which means one of two things. Either you didn't understand a word in the sessions, I'm just being sarcastic, or basically you didn't put an effort to do the mapping and you're expecting us to do it. That's why he said the last, at the end of the email, I'm expecting something, some productive or something efficient or as such.\n\n Now we are where we are, we need to tackle this. The idea is, can we, which I think the Raoul and Bastian exchanged at the end, the naming convention of the templates is something we need to cover, but I don't think it's enough. There are certain missing fields I'll let Raoul explain, that they think are critical to the drilling industry. I think they use the word, or one example is completion plan is the field that...\n\n Completion code. Completion code, you're right. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, we did include it, and they think this is important to drilling because it's the code that confirms that, okay, there is a plan for this well, for it to be, okay, there's excavation and there is extraction, blah, blah, blah. Those are fields that triggered in the... Okay, so if they missed those, how can this solution be drilling specific?\n\n It might be generic. This is one aspect of additional field we need to cover. The other would be, if we are using IBP terminology, is to check what is basically the equivalent, which I think Raul mentioned that we can do this. Is this what we need to fix in the templates? Is that a correct summary? Or there's more to this to this issue? Maybe Raul you'd like to add. If there is a need for clarification, just let's be efficient with the time also.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734531716217,"end_time":1734531732604,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yeah, more you've summarized it. Well, I think initially this is what even the feedback I got that what you summarized it.

How can we make sure that we cover majority of them and not go back and forth and they'll tell us.

With drilling, there is a DWS system or whatever system. There is something that's not always on the S4. So even from their side, it's not straightforward, and that's why Vignesh can help, but not like he did with Amaru and chemicals.\n\n The following is my suggestion. After we fix in the template the additional fields, as Raoul mentioned, BPD, since we captured the whole thing, we'll say, Okay, let's make sure that the template also includes additional drilling specific fields and fix the naming convention to match what they use instead of pure IDP. After we do this, does it make sense? And Bastian, since you said we tried before to use their existing data.\n\n I don't think they'll mind having a session, but keep in mind that Abdul Latif is not a techie. I think there is Asif or someone on his team. We would need, and I know it will take us time, but it will be much less than us sending those templates and not getting any data, because we'll keep waiting and waiting and nothing will happen. Arun, are you here? Sorry. Yeah, there is, Arun is on the call, yes.\n\n Arun, can you hear us? He's on mute, but I can see him on the, his teammates. Arun? No, it's on mute. Because the risk we're running now, although we use the templates to understand the data until the firewall and we have the extractors working, but also it will help us understand the challenges we have, even when the firewall and we can do the integration, we have a third-party system, the DWS, that we need to capture data with.\n\n So the more we understand those challenges or the difficulties or specifics, the easier later on the mainstream extraction will work for us, correct, Bastian and team? So it's not like a wasted time now if we spend on the templates. This is number one. So my suggestion, we fix the template, say that this is the template, this is the adjusted one. We've tried before leveraging your September data. We failed in some areas.\n\n Succeeded in other areas, but we need to show you what we've done, show you how we did the mapping, because it seems you didn't like it from the workshop sample data, and you can guide us. This way, it's not them only doing it, because I'm concerned they will reply too late for us, and it's not only us trying to, just like, what's the word, guess or even invent, as you said, Bastion, which we tried, yield good results.\n\n That's the best I could think of It has to wait till we fix the templates, but at least after that we'll say, guys, okay, we tried working solo, none of us managed, let's do this. It could be half an hour after which we aligned, or it could be more, or a couple of actions, but then we can break this deadlock. Makes sense as a suggestion, if you wanted Arun's opinion, but I think Bastian, you can speak on his behalf.\n\n Have until he joins."},{"start_time":1734532261216,"end_time":1734532265047,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yeah we can give it a try and see what happens."},{"start_time":1734532265047,"end_time":1734532320355,"speaker":{"name":"Naamani, Mohamad"},"words":"Okay so first we need to fix the template and I think Raoul as you said then we can check the template versus the BRD sorry versus the template add any missing fields if in the meantime also we have a question and I don't think Khaled is the expert for drilling if we have a question let's do this but then we'll say okay now Now that the template is updated, we'd like to have another run with you on the data.\n\n I don't think we have other options.

Now, if we exclude all the issues that we're talking about in the drilling template, et cetera, we're telling them, look, on paper, April 30 makes sense. However, prerequisites are the following. That's the story, high level. Some of it is relating to data definition, other to structure. Maybe I'll ask you a few questions to understand the difference between definition and structure.\n\n And we are briefing the team, we're still briefing, it's not there yet, to indicate what help they need to do or what activities they need to do versus us, and to make sure it will be done by then. The first question will be, okay, you have activities that are due by 13th of Jan. Based on your list here, do you think this is feasible or we're dreaming? And the logic here, Bastian and the team, we want to show them that we took their request seriously and we worked on alternative one, saying that it could be done by April 30, but also to show them that this is a two-way That it's also ADNOC's responsibility because some things would have to be done much faster as opposed to the original plan.\n\n Yet, not give them a teaser, telling them April 30 is possible, but those would require a miracle to be done. Then they will say, guys, why are you even wasting our time or teasing us or even misleading us? You're saying it's doable. The conditions you're putting are impossible. It's like, okay, I'm willing to do this, but only if you give me a ton of gold or whatever. I'm being sarcastic for one reason.\n\n Do you think those items can be done knowing ad-hoc limitation in terms of resources? They have so many projects ongoing.

That's even how we agreed to build this plan. But what I'm saying, knowing also what you would work with AdNoc for the last couple of months, we know what they have or not in terms of data or in terms of resources. Do you think this is doable or it's basically really, really aggressive? Like I'll give you an example, although it's different. We have a document called XYZ. Not SDD.\n\n And we think that it will get approved in two days. But based on the experience of SDD, we're now smarter and we know that there is no such thing. I'm not talking about approving a change communication plan which could only have one stakeholder. I'm talking about apples to apples. So based on what we've listed here, are these things that are by nature straightforward, and maybe Raoul also has more visibility than you, Bastian, because he knows the Vignesh and the One ERP team.\n\n Is it possible? Now, maybe we don't have an answer. I'm trying to get us thinking. Tomorrow we can say, look, we're still working with those counterparts, the project team and AdNoc or AdNoc, to validate how feasible this is. But we owe you an answer. And that's why we're saying April is possible, provided this and this. Now, next year or even earlier, they might say, look, OK, tell us the moment, you know, if it's feasible or not, let us know.\n\n We'll tell them, look, this 13th of Jan turned out to be 20, for example, which means the April 30 will push. We owe you this answer and then you can make a decision. My only concern is if we keep delaying this at one point, we would be almost done with our wave one and then there would be some wasted time, but let's take one thing at a time and then we'll figure it out.

For me, support required means, like this thing for demand process, when Firas said, send a few slides, we want to make sure that they Understand, it's more change management and pushing them to accept it.

To your point, so it seems like there is some communication gap between the way I explained to you guys.\n\n This point was understood, I added to this weekly status, sharing this feedback that we have a, based upon the drilling discussion, we have a point which will be a risk, because we are the solution in dependent bomb, but the bomb does not exist in S4 HANA, which means for the solution to work, we will need bomb in S4 HANA. That was the discussion, probably this was not explicitly discussed that if we don't get the bomb, which means the solution will not work.\n\n But that's what I meant when we said the solution depends upon the bomb.

But nothing in here is saying that this is an alternative for a disaster. For me, not being able to go live without bomb is a showstopper. We've been raising hell for the last few days to get an approval because now we have one month of delay.\n\n If we do not give this the right magnitude, Raoul, and again, I'm trying to be involved in everything. Also human. It was communicated as a request for support. Raoul, look, we need to be transparent. Request for support means we need your help and we're trying to do this, but right now there is no risk or issue. If there is a risk or an issue, we should highlight it and say this risk and issue is on the critical path.\n\n It's already going to burn us if we do not have a solution for it by Jan 15. Look, we can have a separate discussion on how to explain or to communicate, so on and so forth. But my point is now, at no intersection or interaction, et cetera, there is an understanding that, let's say, what if Abdul Latif didn't share any alternative, right? Let's take this into consideration. Where are we raising the flag saying the bomb is basically something Seems not possible.\n\n Between which will you said is right. Creating the bomb is one thing.

And what basically took me by surprise is that no, which means no, we need to start fixing it from now. If it takes that long, I mean, you remember, Raoul, how many times we discussed with the help of Khushboo that we need to work on this document that listed?\n\n Okay, we have the following. Data fixes to be done, starting with drilling data. I think we said the first topic is drilling data, this and that, etc. So we knew that there are certain things that are to get to. They expect attention.

Let's say, Raoul, Bastian, Hadi, everyone who's on the call, I didn't know that we have the rest of the team, that there was no alternative plan request.\n\n Our main point would be, Raoul, we'll go to Khaled and through it to the rest of the team saying, guys, we promised you we have certain gaps, and what Khushboo probably started listing those points. There is something that might be a disaster or a showstopper, and it's actually about the bomb. We need you to do this action, and given the other plan, we need this to be done by March 1st. We need you to do this, then we need you to populate the data, have everything ready, so on and so forth.\n\n If you don't have this, we will basically be late, and this could be one of the risks, like to have a risk of approval of design documents.

One that will delay the go live, and another will not delay the go live, but it will reduce the quality of the solution. Like what? I always give the same example because I have limited knowledge.\n\n General versus the work order differentiation between general. Okay, my mind is basically blocked now. Preventive corrective turnaround. Does it stop IBP from going live? Maybe not, but the whole efficiency of differentiation between consumption data related to planning versus that. Will be an issue. However, the bomb thing seems to be a different case. Now I remember when. Yeah, when we discussed this earlier and we said the work around will be creating bomb.\n\n Yeah, so again, let me stop here because so we don't go on a tangent, but these are the two categories that I will and push boo based on which will give priority to the ones that will impact our go live. And based on which we will say, okay, these are the actions needed by date x and y, exactly like we're showing here, we're giving them deadlines for things that originally were not part of our project plan, because the project plan is data preparation, this and that.\n\n Now that we've discovered more gaps in the data, we're saying you need to do more. And by those dates, those dates are aggressive because of the April 30. I think it could be almost the same list if not the same one. Excluding anything not bomb related and will update the dates. Fair enough to move on to finish this discussion. Yes. For this one.
