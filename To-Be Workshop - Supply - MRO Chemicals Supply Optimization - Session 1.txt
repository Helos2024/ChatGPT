Good morning, everyone. So welcome to the supply planning session for chemicals. So just to recap, we've conducted workshops for demand, Inventory planning, and now we'll talk about supply planning regarding number of chemicals. I'm sure now, by now, you're all familiar with the journey agenda. So we'll go quickly with the introduction overview, as well as we'll talk about the process for supply planning.\n\n We'll discuss in details the inputs from a master data perspective, as well as transactional data. We'll also discuss the supply planning algorithms, then the supply chain networks, and finally we'll do a demo from a supply planning perspective. So I'm sure by now you're all familiar with But just quickly, we're going to go through – we're going to perform a walkthrough of a leading practice process from supply planning perspective, as well as to show you how IBP can support your business requirements and processes.\n\n We'll also, by showing you the best practice and leading process will assess the degree of fit, so anything that is, if there's any gaps, we'll highlight them, and then we'll see how we can mitigate those gaps. Lastly, we're going to identify, because we're introducing a new process, so probably there will be some roles that need to be that need to be identified. So, we're now all familiar with where we are.\n\n So, we're at the design stage for supply planning. After this stage, we're going to close all the gaps that we've identified during this workshop and finalize those documents. And then send them for approval. All right, so from a process scope perspective, today what we'll be discussing is the 1.3.4, which is the supply planning chemicals. Yesterday we've talked about the supply planning drilling, and then also this week we'll have workshops for the supply planning and turn them on.\n\n"},{"start_time":1731391923593,"end_time":1731392227537,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Yes. So, good morning, everyone. As we're approaching at the end of the planning cycle here, we're in the supply part where, of course, as we have reviewed, the planning for Ryerson is three to five years, specifically and the planning level will be, well, the main output. So first of all, the main input of this process will be, of course, for some materials, the forecast, we will review more of that, and the inventory policies, meaning safety token reorder point.\n\n And the output of the supply planning will be the procurement plan, how much we need to buy for the next three to five years and the distribution plan distribution plan how much we need to how much stock we need to move between or different locations when possible okay and the focus level will be at material vendor material of course which material are we moving or are we buying to which vendors are we buying and then for the distribution plan and at will be from location, the origin location and the destination location.\n\n And finally, the time bucket will be depending, it will vary depending of the type of product and type of material, but will be as a general rule, monthly, and in some cases will be weekly or even for nightly. We will review more of that. Just a few remarks here regarding the planning horizon of three to five years. We need to think all the time and we need to remind us this all the time that we are here planning.\n\n We are having a medium and long-term planning horizon vision of what are going to be the next steps of the plan. So what are the main benefits that we're looking with that? First of all, an increased equipment reliability. That's one of our main goals here. What doesn't mean that? A decrease in unplanned downtime. We want our equipment in well shape and working with the minimum downtime possible. We also have a better budget Having this long-term visibility allows the team to have a more overall view of the budget and how much they can spend basically.\n\n And with that, we also can start to managing or thinking about long-term contracts because we will have this long-term visibility. And finally, and as a summary of this, overall view is the visibility to make better tactical decisions of managing, as I said, managing new contracts, create new, make, finally the system will give you, will give us the information necessarily to make tactical decisions.\n\n I think we can jump into the next one. So, okay, if we focus here on the chemical side, I'm going to do like a little bit of a recap of the entire process. Remember that we start by integrating, of course, the master data, the different materials, the different locations, the different vendors, and integrating also, of course, as a main input, the historical consumption. With that, we run the statistical forecast – well, we run segmentation and statistical forecast, and after that, the planners will review and collaborate when necessary, okay?\n\n That will serve as the main input for the inventory operators, okay? That will generate the inventory policy. The inventory policy will be safety stock end or reorder point. And that will be the main input for the supply operator that will generate of course a supply plan, meaning purchase requisition and stock transfer requisitions, which then will be again transferred to SRHIME. And also we will have a financial view of this plan which can be compared with a budget if we have a budget for this operation.\n\n I have a question here regarding the supply planning."},{"start_time":1731392227537,"end_time":1731392266831,"speaker":{"name":"Yaser Salem Bin Zubaa (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"What are the rules and responsibility here for the supply planning, exactly here for this stream?

So the first task will be to review if there's any stock out alert regarding the chemicals, right? Let's say there are some activities or the forecast indicates that we will consume X amount of certain material in the next three months. And we see that we don't have stock for that. So that will trigger an alert and someone needs to take action.\n\n So who's going to be responsible for maybe fine expedite an order so we can get the material on time or to maybe change? Ask someone to move certain activities so we don't consume these chemicals. That's one thing. Another thing is to review and I think this these two are the main activities review. First of all, the purchase requisition and release them as well as the STRs, okay? Review them, review the different movements proposed by the system and approve them, okay?\n\n And also, I think those, I will say, are main activities. Just to summarize it, PR release, STO release, others review. And as a final point, I will say maybe, not maybe, as a final point, I will say median and long-term visibility of the plan. At certain point, I think maybe on a quarterly basis, you will have a meeting to say, okay, how much we're going to consume, how much we need to buy for the next three to five years for chemical – in terms of chemical materials.\n\n Who's going to be responsible for monitoring this consumption in this forecast?

If there are any adjustments, so they can do what if analysis, they can increase the lead time and adjust if they want the planning result. Once this is done, if there's no any then it goes to the consolidation. But just before the consolidation of the supply plan, we'll just go over the advanced planning.\n\n So if it's not reordered type planning, what the system will gather is, in addition to what we have at the reordered type planning, is the final demand plan.

Yeah, thank you, Yaser. But yeah, this is the process from a supply planning perspective. So the two key points are, so the roles, you have the inventory controller who will do the planning activities, as well as the system will then determine based on your master data what is the planning type, right, if it's reordered point or advanced planning, and then we'll talk about the details of how the supply plan will look like,"},{"start_time":1731393349465,"end_time":1731393886044,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Let's jump into the supply inputs. Okay, so as I said, We have reviewed this slide in a couple of occasions. So for chemicals, I think we need to – there is just one column that we need to – is for MRO, but not for chemicals, which is the maintenance activity dimension. But for chemicals, the master data we will use is, of course, first of all, material dimension, and here we are working with the technical team to define each one of the attributes that add value to your analysis.\n\n After that, we have the asset dimension. Basically, if we are able to integrate the assets that will consume these chemicals based on historical consumption, that instead of as it could be a functional location, with functional location, we have the cost center. And then we have, of course, last but not least, the location dimension, where we will be able, of course, to sort, to filter the different plants and not plants to group the different I want to also mention again that during the technical session we've been reviewing and we also will have a technical session for supply to review the attributes that needs to be added to either so we can add more value to the analysis.\n\n In terms of, well, this is basically the same thing. It's a more detailed definition of the different master data. We have the location, uh the mro part which in this case will be the the chemical material then we have the target unit of measure in one conversion factor okay um so we can visualize the consumptions and and different units if needed and then we also hear the transportation lanes so in case we are able to transport uh to move the the chemicals between plants, we should we should add that master data, OK?\n\n And with that, we also will add, of course, the lead time. We understand that within the same country, lead time is less than less than than a week. So in terms of planning, in planning terms, zero. But also the load size, the load sizes. Meaning how much is the minimum amount that we can move between location, and this is also valid for vendors. We will review more of that in further slides. In terms of transactional data, we will have the stock on hand, which as you already know, is the current stock at your facilities ready.\n\n Or available to be used. Pool chase orders with the confirmed date, so we don't duplicate pool chases. Then material reservations, pool chase requisitions. Of course, we're going to generate pool chase requisitions from IDP to S4HANA, and from there we're going to integrate back again, so we again don't duplicate the the analysis, the results, and finally the cost per unit so we can have some input, some view regarding how much our plan is going to cost.\n\n Okay, let's go for supply planning inputs now. So this is how it's going to look, the supply planning model. We will have assets that could be also functional locations that basically consume chemicals. These chemicals, these functional locations are linked to plants. That's what we have here, assets and plants. We could also add movement here between plants. And these plants are being sourced of materials from our different vendors.\n\n And here we have a lead time, okay? So, in terms of demand needs, we have, of course, the forecast, but we also have the inventory policy, which is the targets to be stocked and then reordered. We will review that when to use one or the other. In terms of sources of supply, we have, of course, the stock on hand, the stock transfers between location, and then the vendor procurement. Which can be translated, of course, from our planning perspective into POs from S4HANA or PRs that will be also integrated for S4HANA, but eventually will be created in a process that will be triggered from IVP.\n\n So what are the constraints that the system will consider? So we have three types of constraints. Constraint that it means that the system cannot break them. Okay, so we have lead time. For example, if the lead time is six months, but we need the material sooner, there's not. Yeah, okay, sorry. So as I was saying, lead time is a hard constraint, meaning that it cannot be, it has to be respected. Okay, if we have a six month lead time, but we need the material sooner, we cannot arbitrarily say, okay, we can get it in three months.\n\n That is not possible. If we're not able to source the material on time, the system will treat and alert. Okay, load sizes, again, if our vendor If our data establish that a vendor can sort the material, let's say, minimum 1 ton or 50 ton, then even if we need just 1 kilogram, we will have to buy the full ton, OK? That is also a hard constraint. And that applies for rounding and max. If our vendor have a material constraint, meaning that maybe where all this chemical the vendor has a capacity of, let's say, I don't know, 100 trolls per month.\n\n If we need more than that, and that's the only vendor we have, then we will trigger. If we need more than that, then the system will trigger an alert. Another capacity we could add, if needed, is the storage capacity. If we have a certain volume, we need to or plant needs more capacity than that, well, it's not possible. And that, again, will trigger an alert. Then planning calendars, if, for example, we're not able, I don't know, during certain periods, we're not able to move or to buy, that also need to, and you have that information integrated to IVP, that will also be respected.\n\n It needs to be respected. And finally, process horizon. Of course, we will need defining this. It's going to be like one of the final definitions of the system. Let's say for the first six months, we are not able to change our plan because it's already, I don't know, the orders are already created. So it is not possible to make any change. So if we define that, the system takes it as heart was trained.\n\n"},{"start_time":1731393886044,"end_time":1731393886583,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"OK?"},{"start_time":1731393886583,"end_time":1731393911316,"speaker":{"name":"Ali Mohammed Ahmed (ADNOC Onshore - PD)"},"words":"Sorry for interrupting, but I did not understand those point.

You can generate a requirement for the next week or for the next three weeks.

So. We will start by. Understanding both strategies and then we can jump into how we can determine which material will follow which strategy and how we can determine that. So if you know the first the first based on reorder point. And in that case, the logic is pretty straightforward, right?\n\n You check based on certain frequency, you check your current stock, and you compare it against the reorder point generated in IDP and inventory planning, right? If the value is below, your current stock is below your priority point, you order. How much do you order? The maximum. And how much is the maximum? It will be EOQ or lot size. If we have EOQ, we go for EOQ. If we don't have it, we go for lot size.\n\n Then after that, we generate the purchase requisition or the stock transfer requisition in case it's needed. Is what is going to be transferred to S4HANA. The second alternative is we call it advanced supply planning and it's more sophisticated. In this case, we have – in the first case, as I explained, there's no need for a forecast. We will have a forecast in demand planning.

As Rahul was explaining, the second one, advanced supply planning, is more complex, right? It takes into account the constraint. But I will, to illustrate the point, I will give a simple example. So let's say during summer, you are consuming more certain chemicals. So although you have the same safety stock, the – because of the forecast being higher, IDP will recommend to buy more. Whereas in winter, let's say the same chemical because some temperature thing, the consumption goes – decreases, then the recommended amount to be purchased is going to be lower.\n\n Okay? So, it's more – let's call it – it's more intelligent, it's smarter, but it of course relies on certain things, for example, if you have an accurate forecast or reliable forecast. In this case, again, we're going to bring it to the supply module, the forecast, from the demand planning model and process, and also the inventory policy, which is in this case safety stock.

We need we need to have. You need to review it and iteration process until we get the final definition. So, this is basically our proposal to when to use reordered point and when to use supply planning, when to use supply planning. So, first for critical materials, we recommend to use supply planning. Why is that? Because as you know, reordered point acts reactively, meaning that when you consume and you fall below the order point, then you order.\n\n But because these materials are critical, we need to plan not reactively, but proactively. So that's why we recommend the usage of supply plan. And how are we going to define that? Well, we have your BAD segmentation, and that can serve as a Okay, then if the material is not critical, we jump into the next category. Okay, for long lead times, we're going to use, again, advanced supply planning, because with such a long lead time, again, we need to fly very proactively, again, to avoid any stock out.\n\n So how going to be the definition based on a leak time segmentation. We have to work on that. We're just stating leak time segmentation, but we need to work with you to define what is a long leak time. Is it six months? Is it nine months? Is it three months? And what is a short leak time? Okay? Then if the material is not critical and it doesn't have a long leak time, we jump into the next priority, which is high variability demand, OK?\n\n And also advanced supply planning. Because these materials have such an erratic pattern and the demand can fluctuate a lot, we have to use supply planning. And for that, we also will define variability segmentation, OK? Has plenty of proposals in that regard. I think in this sense, we can propose something quickly. Once we have data, of course, we can check how it works and see if it fits your expectation.\n\n Then if the materials, it doesn't have a high variability, we can jump into the next criteria, which is high inventory cost. If the material has It's a very expensive material we plan to use about supply planning because here we avoid excess inventory. If we see there's no consumption, even though then maybe the safety zone is low, then we don't buy it. So it's more – it's to reduce the cost. Okay?\n\n But of course, this is considering first that the material is not critical because that will be the first priority.
