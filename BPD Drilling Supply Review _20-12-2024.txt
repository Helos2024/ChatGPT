Then we have call of orders, fixed orders, self-constraint, the quotas and also we have I think sub-assembly In one of the discussion, I think someone has mentioned about the sub-assembly process as well.\n\n So Rahul, I'm not sure. But yeah, it was discussed. So I've just written a note over here. Then we have target coverage. That is the crucial one. And any adjustment made by the planners in the plan.

Then we have the part like inventory controller and inventory manager they can review any deviation if there is higher right let's say 15 percent or some thresholds then the inventory manager can review only or focus only on those particular values or numbers okay so I have highlighted a screenshot you know oh can we add something more about scenario planning as well this was one of the primary requirement I think it's there it's there yeah okay so this is publish the plan for"},{"start_time":1734688689916,"end_time":1734688707949,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"tendering process also I have mentioned over here okay for new vmi suppliers and uh arun the screenshot which you just added I think that is in another other language can you change it to english see if you see the"},{"start_time":1734688707949,"end_time":1734688716941,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"december 24 it's showing dic oh I think it's oh yeah I understand yeah okay They don't necessarily ask this question."},{"start_time":1734688716941,"end_time":1734688741202,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 2"},"words":"One more thing, the supply, the procurement, sorry, transfer to S4 HANA, the point where you're saying send supply plan to S4 HANA.

PR2PO lead time for call of order approval lead time for order to VMI lead time for PO2. So there are all different time what we identified during the process discussion right so those lead time should reflect somewhere in our solution design details so that we can then work with them to identify where this lead time data can be captured so so I just make sure that this lead time for reflecting somewhere okay That's one point.\n\n Second point, are we putting any example in terms of calculations? Do we have anything which we can demonstrate that if demand is 100 quantity, then how the calculation will work? No, we don't have such calculation.
