He says he'll join. I'll give him a minute.

Bastian Osorio:
I need to log out and log in in my teams. Give me one minute and I come back. OK, yeah, OK. You How was the party the other day? Well, I was going to go to a place that is here next door and they canceled us. When we got back to the entrance, another one was coming out, it was the Argentinian Republic, nearby. It was 2.30 in the morning, at the disco, and there were 20 people at the party. And it was later?

 No, because it arrives late here. Bastion, Rahul said he requested to move it to 4pm UAE time.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Can we do 4pm? Does that work for you?

Bastian Osorio:
What time is it now?

1.38 now, so that makes it around two and a half hours later.
