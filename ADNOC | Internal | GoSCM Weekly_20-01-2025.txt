Pelayo Fernandez:
Hello, team. How are you? Hi. How are you doing?

Pablo Lopez:
Hello.

Saul Portillo:
I think that's.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
and good morning.

Rocio Minguillon:
I really saw the delay. We were on another meeting. We're now here. How are you? Hi, Rocio.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Dean.

Bastian Osorio:
Hi.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Dean.

Rocio Minguillon:
Give me just two seconds to share my screen. Okay, Dean. I went to Toledo.

Bastian Osorio:
It was amazing. I loved it.

Rocio Minguillon:
Glad you liked it.

Bastian Osorio:
I loved it. I loved it.

Rocio Minguillon:
Amazing place. The food is really nice. Did you have something special, Basti? Like some food from there? It's very nice.

Bastian Osorio:
I mean, yeah, I ate plenty of stuff. Very nice. Masapan. Yeah, masapan. But the city is just like, I don't know. It's stunning. It's stunning. Yeah, it's just like from a different era. You feel like a...

Hector Palacios:
I don't know. Medieval?

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, that is the old Spain, you know?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
I feel like wearing a shield and killing some unfaithful infidels. They were my old Spanish genes. I felt like...

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, just like in every corner you have like a store with swords and knives and things like that related to like, how to say, los caballeros. I don't know how to say it in English.

Bastian Osorio:
The knights, knights.

Rocio Minguillon:
The knights, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Knights.

Hector Palacios:
You need to go to Segovia.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
needs next place.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, team, so let's align on the activities of the week. Well, as you may know, next week Hector and Basti are traveling to Abu Dhabi, so the aim of the travel and the trip is to have the unit testing sessions with users that for now the strategy, I think that will be more like a demonstration, because I think I'm not sure if they are going to be on their computers or if they are going to be without computers in the same room.

 But, well, I know that we are all focused on that. So, regarding that, maybe Pasti and Hector, you can help me with the priorities for that objective during this week. Specific things that you need that the team have in mind to achieve that unit testing. Because I don't have anything specific. I mean, the scripts, we already delivered them on Friday. I think that there are some reviews that you can do.



Hector Palacios:
We are having a working session in like 30 minutes.

Rocio Minguillon:
So you will practice that on that session. Okay, perfect.

Bastian Osorio:
But just so everybody and I think it will also, this will be useful for this way one, but for the way two and for anything, we need to have specific user cases. Like take a material or take a few materials or take a category and do the entire process and the results needs to look spotless. Like, oh, on point, this system worked very well and with very easy understanding. Like very, for dummies, examples.

 With Alex for dummies, everything for dummies. So users look at that and say, oh, OK, this thing works. OK, so similar to the thing that is Apple. Yeah, this is a general advice. Of course, it applies to the Wave 1, MRO, and chemicals. But it also applies to the rest. That is the starting point. And then from there, we start building more complex and exciting samples, and then having the baseline of the easiest, basic, high-value-added activities, then we can jump into the most complex topics, like I'm thinking, for example, LTPA, which, of course, we know is going to be more tricky, or I don't know, probably, or drilling.



Rocio Minguillon:
Anything related to drilling is more complex. OK. Yeah, I understand, Basti. I think that it's similar to the script that they already done, but maybe with examples of materials and which result is expected of each step.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No? I think so. Let's have a meeting.

Hector Palacios:
Let's check what we need to build related to that for analytics. Let's think on what are going to examples, because we need to show something that makes sense, like this is for a fast mover, this is for a medium mover, you know, the kind of things that they were asking for.

Bastian Osorio:
Let's take that into the working session.

Hector Palacios:
Let's narrow it, yeah, we need to narrow it down because we have like too many combinations, I don't know which one to focus on right now.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, then some other topics that I have online that we have to prioritize this week, but from the technical perspective, the first thing is the definitions that are still pending. I don't know if you have the meetings, because I don't. I mean the open points meeting. I don't know if you have it, because in those ones is the place to review the technical definitions.

Bastian Osorio:
Regarding that, tomorrow I scheduled a session with Sagar in the morning. Well, in the morning here, probably it's not the morning in India. But with Rahul, with Khushu, and with Punal, and Hector will be there as well. Because they, Rahul, show us basically a screen that I haven't seen. I don't know if any of you guys have seen it, but with multiple hierarchies and attributes and stuff. Like how to save.

 It's not easy because depending on the type of material is how many attributes you get and what are the values, what the meaning of these attributes. So tomorrow we will have a working session and I invited Sagar. It's too early for you right now but so I think with Sagar, I mean I will send you the invitation if you're going to join, you're welcome. So again we didn't get the definitions from them but Rahul showed us this.

 So the idea is with Kushbu, with Kunal, and with Sagar, we tried to figure out a way to integrate all this data into the system. So long story short, it didn't provide any definition and we will have to sort it by ourself with the KPMG team.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay. Okay, amazing. Thank you. Then regarding, I don't know where it is, but regarding the FSDs documents, that is also one priority for this week for the definitions for web one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
We had a meeting today to address the FSG. Last week, I had a meeting with Sagar and Reinaldo. I shared the document with you, Reinaldo. I understand that you said, which sounds for me too early, that you will be able to provide a draft this Friday. That's the idea. Working on that. OK. But if you can send the draft just, or maybe we can schedule a 30-minute meeting to review it on Friday, that will be good.

 And also, in the document that I share, which is in the KPMG folder, you have all the points that need to be addressed in the FSD with a marker, or a 1 or a 2. If it's 1, it needs to be addressed in this part of the project. If it's 2, it it cannot be addressed right now. We will need to park it and address it later.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, it should. Thank you. Are we going to do Ray and Basti two separate documents or there will be a lot of documents? Because Rahul mentioned that we were going to do one FSD per requirement, but no, we're going to do just two. One for Web 1 and one for Web 2.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Rocio Minguillon:
That's right. Perfect. OK, so maybe let's prioritize the one of wave one to have it on Friday, Ray, and then the other one just for an internal review. But the one that for wave one, we should try to share with KPMG by Friday or by Monday. I mean, that's the object. OK. So I think from the technical side, we are aligned on priorities. Then for the configuration side, I will ask you also if you could, when you have this meeting, like after this, if you could take a quick look on the sprints to see if the objectives that we put for Sprint 1 of Wave 1 are achieved or not.

 Just to let me know because for For Wave 1, we should be finishing the Sprint 1 last week. I mean, we still have seven, six weeks of configuration. And we're in Sprint 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks more of configuration. But the Sprint 1, we should have finished. This is the new plan. This is the updated plan. So let me know. This is not the update. I'm sorry, I confused you. Here it is. So. No, we still have that.



Bastian Osorio:
How many weeks do we have for configuration wave one?

Rocio Minguillon:
We still have one, two, three, four, five, six. Six weeks we still have. For wave one? Yes, for wave one. So we should have finished the spring one at least. So I know that we don't have the extra attributes that I think that we're supposed to have in Sprint 1. But yeah, I believe if you can do that review according to the plan that you set at the beginning, that will help me to show the... Because tomorrow Tara will ask me about that percentages.

 So if you can review that Sprint 1. Sprint 1, I will say 100%, let's put 100%. Yeah, I will assume that, but... Okay. Okay. So, then I think that is done. Well, what else?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
And this, I think Basti and Fiamma were working on this, the data requirements for next phases, PPT. So, I think that Basti, you told me that maybe tomorrow you will be able to finish it. So please, as soon as you get it, please share me and I can deal with KPMG and that. Is that okay, Mati? Yeah, I had a review with Fiamma on Friday and I made some observation. She mentioned that she made the correction.

 I need to take another look and and then add a few stuff, but I will be able to deliver tomorrow. Okay, that's nice. Okay, so that's the extra things that I have on this tracking. Well, but I know that we have our unit testing online. So whatever you need, please let me know. I also have some meetings with Tara, me and Emil, and me and her only to raise anything or to ask her anything, because sometimes in the huddle we don't have time to ask about some things like meetings or whatever.

 So please, whatever you need, please let me know so I can manage it. Is there something else that you want to to share it is clear like the week and next tasks yes for me it's clear okay amazing well team thank you very much have a nice day and week see you okay team thank you thank you thanks bye No, one thing, one thing, sorry.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Too late.

Bastian Osorio:
OK, no, good thing that Pelayo and Pablo are here. Good. We can speak in Spanish, right? Yes. Look, we are, we are, there is Rocio, yes. Rocio, the topic that we are working on to, thanks for coming back, to activate Yule. Yule is like a chatbot of AI generative foreign foreign I want it to be soon, and if we don't activate it, I mean, for me, if we don't activate it in this AdNoc thing, we're going to activate it in the IBP of Go, and the idea is to polish some use cases.

 I mean, to have some examples, look, this is what the IBP AI can do, right? So that's going to be a very interesting first challenge for you, and I mean it, to try it out, to play with it and see if we can get something out of it.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, okay, perfect.

Rocio Minguillon:
So they want to start checking it out. And Basti, we agree that I'm going to write to Alejandra now so that she can check the integration, right?

Bastian Osorio:
Just in case. But for TNOC or GO?

Rocio Minguillon:
For whatever. I mean, investing, how do you do that? And that they tell us what to ask them, whatever.

Bastian Osorio:
Yes, but you can't, I mean, if you have time, you have to be fast, because we have to move fast, I mean, you can't, you can't answer me for weeks, look, I read it, it doesn't work. No, no, no, no foreign oh you you I'm going to put it up there.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
you
