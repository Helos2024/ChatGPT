So looking at the image, so we still have pending drilling? Yes, and BRD I think, yeah. And the BRD, yeah. But I think it's more related to the person than, yeah. Oh man, this project has been pain in the ass. It's too bureaucratic. I feel we are not progressing anything. I think we need to get the approvals for the SDD and for the, all the BRDs and their work.\n\n We can start making some substantial progress. But before that, it's very hard. And I think this is creating frustration in the customer, which is, I think, understandable up to a certain point. And also for us, it's getting frustrating. Also, I feel, I don't know what's your feeling that KPMG is not adding as much value. I mean, they should be the, I mean, I understand they, we need to cover some aspect of the documentation.\n\n But they, I mean, considering the amount of resources they have, they have Cunal, they have Cheryl, they have Mofakori, they have, of course, Hadi, I don't know how many project managers. And it seems like every single point they need confirmation of the work from us is very inefficient and at the end everything relies on us. It seems like he cannot change a dot without asking us in the document. So just so you know, of course we all were aware of all these issues of the general situation situation since a few months ago, but we're going to rise a bit again next week and if we need to involve like Go SEMs, more senior management, I don't know, Cesar, Felipe, we will do it.\n\n But I would like to know before starting the meeting, what's your feeling, general feeling with the project, with the client, with KPMG?"},{"start_time":1734696395391,"end_time":1734696570249,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Yes. Joined to this project. So I was expecting that we'll be taking care of the overall thing. That was my assumption, the process and everything. But after the kickoff and everything, I came to know that KPMG is handling the process and the data part and we'll be doing the technical part. But then we started working on... We were not part of the ASIS. Was. They were driving those discussions. We were mostly handling the 2B discussion because there I started conversation with the business and also I started working on few of the items on drilling part.\n\n So I thought that we are working from the technical side. The process and the data part will be handled only by KPMG because even I asked Seba when we were in Abu Dhabi during the kickoff that what role of KPMG. So they were supposed to handle the data and process. So my basic query is that we should not be working on this BPD, BRD documentation. Only the integration structure, where they have mentioned a few sections about the integration, there we should have added inputs.\n\n But the rest should have been driven by the KPMG APMG because they are the process owners, they are the data owners or the data medium between the ad-hoc and us, the technical teams. So they should be taking responsibility, but now it's like they are not efficiently doing that. They are involving us to drive the decision, which is not, I think, which is not accurate when when we started the project.\n\n So I think we are deviating in some other directions. And that is quite frustrating, you know, for the business as well, because I think KPMG is not driving those decisions by themselves. They are relying on us for the process and for the data. Because now the drilling data, right? We have to we don't have all the information we can create okay but the data driven part has to be done by the KPMG not by us that is my yeah that is my only concern okay and that is that is that could be one of the thing that is creating you know confusion uh a misunderstanding with the business and even explosions the safest method is showing I don't know, some question or do you think about that?\n\n"},{"start_time":1734696570249,"end_time":1734696625880,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, yeah, we agree. I agree. I think they rely way too much on us. I think we need to push and here we need more senior management involved in to give them more responsibility. So they have to take this. At the end, we should be dealing with IVP, we should be focusing on configuration of testing data and all the integration of course we have over here that should be our role and of course we can give some inputs regarding A, B and C that's not a problem but it seems like we need to I mean that for example the process the process team is useless I mean if you if you take a look at the process diagram they have created they are shit I mean they They have no expertise on this.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734696625880,"end_time":1734696645377,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Because when Kunal asked me to work on this BPD document and he assigned my name on process detail, I was like, you are the process owner, you need to write all those details."},{"start_time":1734696645377,"end_time":1734696649391,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"We weren't even part of the AS-IS."},{"start_time":1734696649391,"end_time":1734696663718,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Exactly.

It was something like a very superficial, very, very, I don't know, simplistic analysis they did. And they charge, I don't know how many millions they charge for that. Yeah, they put just all the Mara and Marcy in a, power bi table and they basically sorted the information and that's it that's it for that they charge I don't know how much.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734696713490,"end_time":1734696745959,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Correct and it's of no use also like you know MRO chemical drilling so that analysis is not at all helpful like we just got a filter that we can get directly from Vignesh also and we can also check that much like number of entries in SAP So it was not at all meaningful session.

I understand that we are not an expert in green or oil and gas experts. But we are experts in ABB, there's no doubt about it. I challenge everyone to say the opposite. But I feel they are, of course, they're not experts, but at least you have to be willing to learn and to research. And I think we're missing that part. I think, yeah, they need to take more responsibility and they need to start learning.\n\n For example, for change management, I haven't seen any progress on that track. If they don't know process management, I don't know, start reading books, start meeting people that know more than you and get some insights and start working. But I haven't seen anything from them. I haven't seen a thing from them. Okay. We're going to take that as I said with more senior management because just from us it's not working.\n\n So now let's jump to what is important. Let's start working with the information. Do you want me to share my screen?

And here, I think Vignesh is for Ali. It is very good that we have Vignesh. He's very nice as well. So I have here filter just the 2B. And based on this, let's put it. So based on the initial definition, this, for example, here, I assume that everything should be this. I mean, if the completion code defines the entire basket This number should be the same for all the wells, but as we're seeing, it's not the same.\n\n We have, in this case, three different quantities, and then you have more materials here. So I guess, but if we see this here, slope recovery, Neal Horace, and then I don't know what's the difference between this and this. I don't know. What is that? I mean, how we can determine the amount because there are to be is to, to be what's the difference between this ones."},{"start_time":1734696947362,"end_time":1734696979719,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"So basically what they're saying machine that the bomb, right?

It's just, it looks like, is a different bomb for me. So it will be easier to make the distinction right away from the data.\n\n I mean, start with the two different material baskets. Then from 14 to 10, in this case, I believe you can make the difference. You can adjust it manually.
