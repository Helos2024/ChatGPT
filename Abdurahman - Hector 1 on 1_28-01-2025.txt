UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Hello, hi? Hello, hello?

Hector Palacios:
you Hello? Abdurahman? Hello? Can you hear me?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yeah, I can hear you.

Hector Palacios:
Long time no see, man. Since the interview. Yes. How are you?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I'm doing well, man. Doing well.

Hector Palacios:
The point is that... Sorry, I'm just putting my camera on. Tomorrow I have a big presentation for this company called AdNoc. I think that I told you in the chat.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Do you know who these guys are? They are pharma for pharmatical industry.

Hector Palacios:
No, these are like the oil and gas company of UAE. So they are they are the money for that country, you know, the CEO of that company is a minister of I don't know what, but it's like a arrived from the government. Is it in Egypt? No, that's on UAE, in Abu Dhabi. Okay. It's called Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. So it's the state-owned company of the UAE. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's a big one. And while that is one of the big products that we have here, on the zone and tomorrow we have a session with them.

 So yeah, this week I've been full about preparing the presentation, you know, the deck and the system as well to show something tomorrow. So that's why I couldn't join yesterday because you joined yesterday, right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, yesterday was my first day. I had an onboarding meeting with Yara. She gave me some summary about the company, how it start and the offices in Chile and Mexico and Spain. And she also illustrated to me the working She sent me a survey to choose working from home or workspace. I chose work from home and send it to her. Also, she asked me to search for the laptop price in Egypt. I sent her an email with a screenshot from Amazon Egypt.

 With the price and also I created the deal account and signed the offer. Also today I created SAP ID. I received an email to create a SAP account, a global SAP account.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, that probably internal IDP. We have an internal IDP for us, just for the consultants to learn in and that kind of stuff. So probably it's for accessing that. Do you have the contract? Is it ready? The contract is already signed off or do you need to do something there?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
On deal? The contract on deal?

Hector Palacios:
Your working contract. I don't know if deal maybe yes but not really sure because they depending on the case you know different countries different ways to do it uh if they are paying you by deal then maybe yes you also need to do the the contract by deal uh but but I guess that that is something that you can ask to Omar. Omar is working in the same way right with deal and all of that so um I will ask him to be like your official buddy because we we have like this role in OSCM that basically we are going to assign you someone that is more close to you.

 In this case, Omar is like the obvious choice, right? Because you are friends with Omar, both are from Egypt, so he can help you a lot with all the problems that he already had. He can teach you now. So I will ask him to be that person for you. So like a first contact person. That doesn't mean that you can not talk to me. Of course, we need to maintain a fluid communication, saying whatever you need, you can come to me, no problem.

 Always, right? But we will have Omar because Omar is more in, we'll have the same kind of problems than you. For example, the contract is not something that I can know because I'm from Chile and I have one way working and I don't have DL, you know? So this kind of stuff, I think that Omar is going to be more helpful than me. Great, so it's just a starting point. The laptop, did they tell you about a specific model or something like that to look at?



Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, she sent me a specific model, but this model is not in Egypt. I sent her another.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I don't think that has exactly the same model, but this one of this Lenovo ThinkPad.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Lenovo ThinkPad, yes. T16, but I didn't find T16 in Egypt. I found E16. Try to find the next one better.

Hector Palacios:
I don't know. Something very similar, but the next one better and should be enough. At least my experience with this laptop is very good. They are pretty For T16?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I don't know. I don't know, man.

Hector Palacios:
I mean, they are very, like, in sync, but I think that we have many. Let me check the mine. Let me check that. I probably need to go to the Lenovo page. Lenovo bridge. Me one second. You And our drivers. Yes, let me share the screen just one second. Of course. First time that I do it on this laptop because this laptop is like less than three months old probably.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Well, I have this one and it's working pretty fine. Okay. I found E16 also. E16. Okay.

Hector Palacios:
That's better than mine probably. So if that's It should be enough. It should be very good. OK. This E14 one. No, no, no. This is dirty. If you find a better one, do it. No problem. If the one that Iara was suggesting is better than this, like E16, I guess that is better.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
It's T. Iara sent me one with T, T16. I didn't found it in Egypt.

Hector Palacios:
Oh, OK. Well, uh, take this as a reference and maybe you can ask that GPT. What is the, like the most close one and to the one that I share and maybe you can find something. Yeah. These laptops are pretty good. Then I also understand that you have, um, you will have some, uh, for, for the work from home. I seen that they are going to give you some money to buy some stuff.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
You have $400 a year.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Great, that's great, that's great.

Hector Palacios:
That is enough so you can find maybe an additional screen or I don't know if you need to buy the whole desktop, but it's fine, it's great.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, okay, I will choose a chair, economic chair and a screen at first.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Great.

Hector Palacios:
And so having that now in Egypt, we have two persons there. So you and Omar, I guess that for when we have this monthly alignment meeting, because we have, every month we have an alignment meeting and you know, the Chile cluster, they come together, the Argentina, in Buenos Aires and in Cordoba sometimes, and here in Spain, the ones in Madrid, we get together. At least you can start doing that on Egypt now, on El Cairo, maybe you can meet I don't know if you can reserve an office maybe, or if you can go to one another home, because that also happens, especially that we are two only, you are two.

 But I think that sooner than later, we will start having more people there. So it's great. Because Egypt is building a cluster, basically. The same that we have in Madrid. In Egypt, the idea is that you have a one go SCM office in the future and you are the the first two so that's uh I think that it's a good a good position if you ask me uh when I started in chile it was like that when I started in chile we were 10 you know uh and and then I started growing with the company and I was able to access opportunities because I was the the one that was in the beginning you know so it's going to happen the same for you now you have Farmer overseas that is one company, you know, I'm not project resource on the Sun Then it's an outbreak that probably you will be assigned to that produce coin a body in a body.

 I don't remember but Yeah, I think that for you it's a it's a brand for electronics I think yes Yeah, exactly. That is a big company. Yeah, and it's a very big break for Yes, it's very known in Egypt.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Great.

Hector Palacios:
So it's very, very likely that you are going to be there on that project and with Oman. Yeah, and more people as well, but you will be, both of you, I think that will be assigned to that project. It's very, very likely. I need to confirm, but I think that that is like the new because every now and a while you we have a big new break you know and this one is on egypt and we were lucky people and they are trying to bring people from I don't know from south america to here for that you know so it's very very likely that you go directly there because I think that so far they haven't tell you right uh if you are assigned to a specific project no okay they haven't communicated okay Let me check on my site.

 I can confirm that. But that should be on the short term. I don't know if they're right now or in the next month. I'm totally blind. I don't know. So let me check because I know the salespeople, they are working here for Madrid as well. So they should know when they should start. OK, so that's fine. And what else, man? So what I do in my cluster, and the same thing that I'm doing with Omar, is that we have open communication.

 So whatever problem issue you're facing, we can connect always. Please feel that from my side, feel the trust to doing that. And then we are also having like a checkpoint every two weeks, just to know how you are doing on YCM, if you are learning problems, if I can help you with something. It's like the minimum frequency just to have like an update, you know, to know how you are doing here. But that doesn't mean that should be like the normal frequency.

 We can meet in a high frequency, especially now that you are new. Maybe I will put it like once or twice a week, a session. So I can start teaching you or shaking you on how you are progressing. Why am I telling you this? Because when you enter to OSCM, we do something called Godaverse. It's like the learning system that we have on OSCM. And there you will have videos that will tell you, teach you how to use IBB, the basics, and then the demand part, the inventory part, the supply part, all of that.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
So... They are the same videos I watch it during the presentation phase or different.

Hector Palacios:
Same ones, but you will have more access because probably they gave you. I have never seen that platform, if I'm honest, because I am very old here in the company. This is new, like three years ago, maybe. So I haven't taken a course there, but The first part, they told me that it's good. You can learn a lot about the basics, about demand. The second part, they have told me that it's not really good.

 So in that case, maybe we will take some classes in our home, like you and me, trying to learn that part. But at the beginning, let's use the material we have. I will start sharing whatever I have. Because I have some interesting material like starting that you can use and to use as a reference not telling you that yeah if I send you a book I'm not expecting you to read it but you have it if you have any question you can take it maybe upload that to chat DVD you know and get a straight answer for what you are looking for things like that so yeah I think that the very first step now you don't have a project assigned, is to focus on that goal average, trying to get to learn the most you can as fast as possible.

 Okay. So normal expectation is like in one month, you can complete the goal average, right? Because at the end, it can be more, it can be less, it's depending on what are the circumstances because, you know, you are not in a project maybe the expectation is that you dedicate full time to that but then if you are starting an upgrade then of course the project is priority so you can start paying more attention to the project and trying to get the good hours but in parallel so it's not the same situation okay um when you finish the good hours it will be like the interview remember that you did a Now we'll deal with the data and the model.

 So in this case, it's like you will learn how to work on the system and you will show us a demonstration of the system. That is something that as soon as you finish, they gave you like two weeks to do it. And then you will present it to me and Celestian, the other guy that you knew on the meeting and the meeting that we have. Remember that one? Red hair guy yes with glasses yes yeah that one Sebastian so this is after two weeks from now no no two weeks after you finish the the learning so if the learning that my expectation is like let's take one month because I have one one guy from Spain here and he was able to do it in one month so he was educated the mornings, because he was also signing a project, so the afternoon was like project, the morning was got ours, and in one month was able to check it.

 So I think that one month is a reference at least, but can take less, can take more as well. When you finish, we need to send an email to not IARA, but one of the team, human resources, you know, people team, they call themselves people um and we can ask him to provide the like the instructions and the the final exam let's say and then you have two weeks for doing it okay and I will be helping you as well of course the the most that you can get on your own is the best because you are going to learn that way if you are with me you will get all the answers like right away and maybe that now the best option to learn.

 But yes, I will be there for helping you as well to get this on. Especially for the reason that I told you that the second part of this is not quite good. So the learning system is a good idea, but we need to develop a little bit more there. But yeah, I can help you with the second part because I think that the material, especially on English, that is kind of non-existing. I think that there is a difference because the GoTowers initially is in Spanish.

 I think that some guys have been doing some videos in English, but I don't know how much of the content is in English, you know? So that can be a limitation. Let's check that during these weeks, the content that you're seeing. Maybe I can ask the guy here, Pablo, if the content is similar or less. We can see how it goes, okay? Okay. But it's a starting point, at least. I think that the SAP email that you received is for that.

 Did you create the account already?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I created one with my own email then I created another one with the S1 I received today. Do you have an email?

Hector Palacios:
I think that you do, right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, they sent me in the email something Yes, it's user.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's user.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, yeah, probably it's that. But let me, I will start taking some points to share with you.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
This one. Link your newly created s-user to your sap universal IDs. So I created this one with my own email and then link this one with it. This is my own email I created it today and you also have this user and this is the issue.

Hector Palacios:
The second one is probably the one that you will need to use. The first one, it doesn't matter. I don't think that is going to be an issue. But with that OSCM email, I'm expecting you to be able to log in and so on. So let me check for the Goto account and all of that.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Give me one second. I received the Gutaverse account also.

Hector Palacios:
Ah, you received it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, that's fine.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Can you show me that one? Yes. I think on Teams, I will check.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, we're not Teams. This one. Great. Well, that is for the Votaverse.

Hector Palacios:
That's one thing that we need to have access also. Votaverse, I'm not the expert one, as I told you. So if we have any questions, please reach to Omar. He will know better. But probably he will tell you that it's not that good. I don't think that Omar has the best opinion on this, but the first videos, at least I think that they are going to be fine. The second part, as we already said, we will need to check to them.

 That is one thing. So the other thing is that you have access to Go SCM IDP.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So IDP is a system that we usually implement.

Hector Palacios:
You are a consultant of IDP. The customers, they have their own IDP, but we also have one IDP in general, so you can play. It's a playground, basically a sandbox. So you can play and create your own system. And so on.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
And this, I will do this on now on my laptop or when I receive the laptop? No, you're gonna start right away.

Hector Palacios:
Don't wait for the last laptop because I don't know how much it's going to take. You're gonna start checking the videos from now.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
So, binary configuration.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I see that these are the basics. Also, Omar, I met Omar yesterday. What was the question?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I didn't get it.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yesterday, I met Omar at my working day. I spent the working day with Omar at the shared space place and he gave me a document to start this one. That's great, man. Let me see if that's the same. Let me check on my side.

Hector Palacios:
Give me one second. For sure, that is going to be a good document. So if you want to read it entirely, you're welcome. I'm not that kind of people. I don't read these whole documents. I usually look for what I need. To know in that moment. But I can give you another one that can help you as a reference. Let me check because I've been sharing these things with Omar in the past. Maybe I can just give you a forward.

 Give me one second. Because there is an IDP certification, right? So what I have, yeah, here I have it. Let me share it. I will share it by Teams. OK. Forward. Abdurahman.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
There. OK. I received.

Hector Palacios:
This is like the training material or like, yeah, the training material. Year for a certification of IDP. That in the future if you want to increase, I don't know, your curriculum, your resume, you can have a certification on IDP and that for sure is something great that Goesim is going to pay for you. So if you want to have that, I think that is only beneficial for you. Especially when you are they put like they give you a high importance to the consultants that are certified you know so it's basically when you are just starting to have a certification maybe our idea but first of all it's the Goddard's and then if you are interested you always have the the door open to do this yeah you always have this is for you for like a study and then in the future or maybe next year, I'm not saying like the next month or the next quarter, it can be the next year.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
If you want you can start learning about this and take the certification and GoSCM is going to pay for that. Okay, so you think studying for a certification is not a priority now?

Hector Palacios:
No, it's not a priority. Priority for you is to learn the do the others because this kind of mandatory for us to do it and then learning whatever you can in your project and after that basically if you want to do the certification you can do it but it's up to you it's not mandatory it's just like a benefit if you want to take the challenge I see man I see that you have omar in the chat you You have Aelsu, you have

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Santiago.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Ah, yes. I just... Do you know them?

Hector Palacios:
Is it because you know them or because they are assigned you to their project?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
No, no. I just... Santi is the first one I met him in Egypt with Omar last year when he came. So I had him on Instagram and we have some chat. So when I have the goal He is the first one I sent him hi. And also, Elsio, I met him last week when he came to Egypt with Omar and Marcelo. I met Marcelo also. So I just sent him hi. Yeah, that's right.

Hector Palacios:
I know Santiago. Santiago is part of my team as well, like you no one and I'll show it is one one guy like me he's in like in the same position uh and he's really really smart and he knows a lot and he's a really good person I'll see it's really nice I don't know in a lot a lot but the the times that I I've seen him he's very nice uh so yeah I I don't know if they are going to maybe assign little bit to that project.

 Not really sure because that project is finishing, you know, so maybe if you can join, it can be great in the meantime. But otherwise, I don't know. I will check with Sebastian what we can do in the meantime. I already asked Yara if she knows something about it, if like it's clear to what project you are going or when is it starting the other project because maybe in the meantime, I can assign you to ad hoc or to farm overseas just to be there, you know, like hearing, to seeing what they are doing, how is the debris developing, how the people interact.

 Of course, you are not going to get anything at the beginning, but it's like you start getting familiar with how is the dynamics of the debris. Okay, so I'm taking as you already have the access to the Goddard, that's right. I'm taking the one for IDP. I will ask them to provide you access as well because part of the Goddard is not just learning there but also doing some practical exercises. So yeah, that is ideal that you have that already access.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Hector Palacios:
Give me one second because I'm taking note of all these points or CMIP whatever sex is already Omar Omar as body informally Omar is going to be your body even if I know that if I'm not assigned Omar officially I know that is going to answer any question you have but but I will assign it officially so just for you to know whatever question you have is the best one is from He knows a lot already, so yeah.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
Access, what else I was thinking on?

Hector Palacios:
Yes, IEB access. Yeah, but I'm missing something. Project assignment. And then I need to schedule some meetings. I don't know what else to mention. I think that, of course, you will have a lot of questions, but also we will have a lot of time to answer question by questions. I don't want to overwhelm you with information as well. So for the For now, it's the Gotoverse and the Access to ID. That's the two things because the faster you learn, the faster that you will forget about this because it's also an additional test and all of that.

 Hopefully, you can get rid of that as soon as possible and also learn as fast as possible. Then to dedicate to a project as soon as we have an assignment, you can start dedicating because reality is that the GoTowers is great. It's great because you will have anticipated involvement, something on IBT. For example, supply planning sometimes is not something that you get to see on your project, but for the next project.

 So the GoTowers is going to give you an initial introduction to that. So that's fine. That's great. But in reality, then you are going to learn in the project by doing it and by being with the people in the project, right? Yes. So yes, that's why I think that it's important to try to get the good hours as fast as possible so you can remove that task from the list and focus 100% to the project where you are going to learn.

 But to be able to learn faster in the project is good to have the good as well. Do you have any questions about whatever situation you are in right now or the project or the company?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I don't know. I wanted to know your experience about soft needed to face customers in the project and to be a project leader. I think I'm good, but it may be a different type of work. This starts with Go. So I need to know what to focus on and also to have a mentor to tell me that if you are better or what is my weak point to work with.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, so let me tell you how it is. So you will have different focal points. For sure you will have me as the, I don't know if a mentor because maybe are going to learn most of from other people that are working with you in the project, that's the reality. I will try to be very present with you, like to be very present in the beginning, to be with you like every twice a week to give you some feedback, but as I'm not going to participate in a break with you, at least not now, I don't know about the future, maybe yes, but right now we are are going to be probably in different projects.

 So I won't have that direct feedback to tell you, OK, we work together in this session with the customer and you can improve this or that. Probably that's something that you can get from your co-workers, from Omar, from whoever is the architect or the leader of the project. They can help you with that. You need to trust the people. You need to ask them directly. If you don't ask directly, there is another feedback that will give you twice a year, depending on your position.

 So you have promotions, right? So you have different levels. I think that until a certain level, you have twice a week, sorry, twice a year, the possibility of doing a promotion. So that is in August. Sorry, first one is on February. That's the official one. Everyone is participating. But then for the ones that are in beginning roles, you have another chance in August. So that means that if you do it fine, you can promote twice a year, two times.

 Then you start with the normal cycle. So that is once a year. So in that promotion, you will receive feedback from me, probably, from your project from your co-workers and from the customer, okay? The customer is going to give you, at the beginning, they are going to evaluate you, but that is not going to count because they don't know that you're just starting, probably, or they don't know about the levels, so they don't know this is a consultant one, two, or three, they have no idea, right?

 At the beginning, especially that you are not interacting a lot with them. You can receive the feedback, but it's not going to be useful for your promotion at the end. It's just an internal feedback as a reference, you know. In the future, when you are in a higher position in which you are interacting, leading, and all of that, you will receive a feedback from the customer and they will tell you in the promotion.

 And that is going to be part of the promotion So maybe, I don't know, 30% from the leader, 30% from the customer, the rest from the co-workers. There is a specific way for the final grade or evaluation, so you can promote or not. So that's one thing. If you ask me if it is important, yeah, I think that in every work, in every job, basically it is especially if you want to go to new layers you know because yeah you maybe you can stay in one position your whole life and you can be technical and excellent at it but if you don't have soft skills it's not going to work.

 I am telling you this from personal experience because in my case I think that when I got out of college I didn't like very good social skills, soft skills. And I was pretty technical, very, very technical, very good at numbers, programming, software, whatever. That kind of stuff is like my strong, my strengths. But the soft skills is something that I learned by exposure, practice, experience. It's something that they just basically put me on the sessions.

 I need to start learning, teaching people, leading sessions with the time. And that's what gave to me the subskills. That is not something that I came here with the subskills. It's something that I learned doing the job. So I think that the job is an excellent opportunity to develop that experience. In the first years, probably you will have that opportunity to be on the sessions, but there's going to be other people that are going to be responsible, right?

 So maybe you can take this part and you can do these sessions, you know, but always what you can deliver, what you know, what is in your knowledge, let's say, what you can do. So it's going to be changing gradually, of course, when you have more experience you will have more responsibility and so on and you will be facing the customers by your own but that's going to happen in the next years I guess.

 In the beginning the expectation is that you can help in some aspect of the project but of course you are not going to be leading all the sessions, not at the beginning at least. But my recommendation is that if you feel that it's something that you want to develop, take the opportunities. If they give you the opportunities, they tell you, Abdurahman, do you want to present this on the session? Go with that then.

 Go with that. I think that the early exposure is the best. We have a saying here in Chile, I don't know if that's something like global or not, but it's like throwing you to the pool. When you don't know how to swim? It's like throwing you to the pool. Yeah, okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
We have it in Arabic, in Egyptian Arabic, in the sea. Okay, that's the same.

Hector Palacios:
It's like you don't know how to swim but you need to jump and then learn how to swim in the water. It's something like that. I wouldn't say that it's the most comfortable. It is indeed. The other way around is out of the comfort zone but as you may know comfort zone is when you learn the most and when you grow the most. So I would suggest you take those opportunities. I've been doing it that way. Sometimes it was too much, but I was able to do it and that was great because it gave me opportunities and you can grow faster as well if you take these leadership roles.

 So as soon as you have the opportunity, my suggestion is do it. Do it. Okay. Try to go with that. And you will realize that this in the same session because there is a lot of questions like what I say, how I say it, what if they ask me that and so on. So a lot of things that you need to think on your mind and to be prepared like to add trying to anticipate and basically that is how you learn to to deal with these sessions, like to improvise, to prepare the content, to know what kind of questions they are going to ask you, what kind of users are usually the people that we met, and so on.

 So whenever you have questions about this, Hector, how I say this, or I need to do this, how you recommend to do it, I can be there, of course. So you can ask me. You can ask me and I can tell you I would do it this way or no, no, no. Don't go that way. That's too detailed. These guys are not going to grasp it. You know, it's a delicate balance, I guess. That is coming from experience and the door is opening that I can teach you whatever you need, right?

 Thank you. No, no problem. That's my job. If you are in my classroom, my job is that you can develop that you can feel that in the company you are learning a lot, that this is a good opportunity and so on. So yeah, let's do it that way. But I think, I mean, the way that I've been developing so far is learning by doing. So I think that the best is always have the option, the challenge, because that is like the voltage, you know, it's generating a need.

 And when you have a need, then you work toward that need, right? So if you have a session, then you need to learn how to deal with a session. And that will be the opportunity for learning and to put your whole mind, your whole focus on doing that. So I think that is the best case scenario. If you start learning now, but then you don't practice that, I don't know if that's going to be very useful. So I think that it's better to put yourself in the situation and then deal with it.

 That's the best way to look at it. Yes. So let's do that. I mean, I think that Omar is doing great. Because I think that like one week ago, they showed a video of Omar presenting in public. So he was in front of many people on that project and was presenting to some big guys from the company. And so, yeah, he was excited. Exposing himself to that situation and I'm sure that he learned a lot. So I'm not saying that this is going to happen soon.

 I mean, this happened for Omar like one year after. But you can have like this initial approaches to the customer, maybe one advantage that Omar doesn't like this because he doesn't want to be cut along with this. But of course, you have an advantage that you speak language, right? So that is like a huge opportunity for you to be facing the customer because the guys like Santiago, Ael, Sumi, we are going to be talking in English.

 We can connect with them, but not at the same level that you can connect. So for you, that's an opportunity. Don't see it as something bad because I know that Omar doesn't like to be the Arabic speaker, but And for me, as I see it, it's an opportunity to grab it because sometimes I think that it's very likely that being in Egypt, you are in a company that is from Egypt, Abadi, and there is going to be people that is going to be much more comfortable speaking Arabic with you than in English with Aelsio or me or Shanti or whoever, you know?

 To be a good opportunity and that you can learn very fast taking those kind of opportunities in your career.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So that's it, man.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Sorry, it took a lot.

Hector Palacios:
No, no, thank you for your time.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Let me know if you are having any questions.

Hector Palacios:
You can just write me if you have an additional question. Now we can stay some minutes, no problem. But I will put a session twice a week so don't don't feel the pressure that let's ask everything to actor right now or we can have more sessions to to be uh checking how you are progressing and if you are having questions I can help you in those same same sessions as well um and as I say in the middle if you have any questions you can write me we can meet for five minutes or we can just chat uh the event door is open, so you can reach to me whenever you want.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Great.

Hector Palacios:
Do you have any question, Matt, or it's fine? No, now fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, perfect.

Hector Palacios:
Well, welcome, Matt. I'm very happy that you are there. I'm also very happy that now you are too in Egypt, because I know that Omar was feeling really alone. I think that Yeah, yeah. No, it's true. It's true. So we need to start building a community. I hope that sooner than later, more people start joining to the company. And with this project on Avadi, I think that this is another opportunity to be there presentially and to meet people from, I don't know, from GoSGM, from other parts of the world.

 And hopefully sooner than later, we have GoDay. GoDay, by the way, we have like one day of event on the on the company once a year because in the companies you always have it on December right but during the year we also meet because as we are consultants from every part of the world and we are working with different customers different teams we like to have these events in which we came together right so in the last one that we had in December for example Omar came here to Madrid and we have the event here.

 So I know that there is one event on August this year, and probably in December it's going to happen again. But if we don't have an opportunity before, it's very likely that on August we have a day and that you came here. Yes, can I join this day? Yeah, Omar did it. Okay. The last one. So that's when I meet him for the first time. So probably he's going to be here in Madrid because here is where you have most of the people on the zone.

 But I don't know. Let's see. Just keep in mind the passport, you know, you need to have the visa, I think. Just check with the reservation because I think that the first time that Omar could do it, he couldn't because of the visa. Okay it's something that take more time so check that if you need to do something for europe I think that you need to do but omar knows yes can I have an an invitation letter from go that for sure that is not going to be an issue you will have the invitation later and whatever you need um but just think think on that um you know you can ask somewhere already.

 Yeah, because I don't know with how much anticipation, because imagine that you need to, we are thinking on August, that means that maybe on June you need to start doing the paperwork. Let's see, hopefully it's not that complicated, but just in case, so maybe we can meet on August.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I hope that, and I am really very happy to to join. You know, last week on Thursday was my last working day at EBB and I had a farewell with my friends. It was a lot of mixed feelings, happy and sad at the same time. I received a lot of gifts from my friends and also was said farewell and for me also it is a new beginning and a new career is better for me and a new lifestyle also because now I can have more flexibility in working from home, not just going to the factory for five years last five years.

 You can try the board games.

Hector Palacios:
Your only limitation right now is the time zone. That's the only limitation.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Again, please.

Hector Palacios:
The time zone is the only limitation. For example, if you have operated on China, if you're on China, maybe that is an issue because, you know, it's late hours. But that's the only limitation. You roughly, you can be whatever you want.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, for that I am very excited about career and also about life, to have a better life and to be a better person, learn a lot and do what makes me better.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, it's an exciting opportunity. I assume that I already told you in the interview, but we are growing here. We are growing a lot, like every year, because there is a lot of space to grow. Like in the beginning, you know, you are just starting. The good thing is that there is behind is new territory for us. It's Egypt, the Middle East, Europe, but behind you have a big company with a lot of people that is really nice people.

 I can tell you, I've been working with this guy like 30 years and everyone that I know is a really nice person. And they are willing to share knowledge, you know, so you can have like a big muscle behind, big back to support you. But you are in a strategic position because you are just starting a new market. So that is just exciting for you. That is only... Omar can tell you. He just knew, like he said, the position like last week, because he was thinking like, I don't know if I want to stay in WCM because I feel alone and all of that.

 But he realized that we care a lot of Egypt. Not only Egypt, the whole Middle East. Please feel that you are going to be important. You are going to be at the end. We are growing the leaders of tomorrow on Wexin because we are expecting to be big here. We are already big there. I mean, we are not a big company, but for the things that we do, that is like niche, something very specific. We are the best ones there.

 So we want to be the best ones here. We want to get a lot of praise, being one of the first. That will put you in a very good position later. That's the reality, because you are starting, then you are the first one that is going to be a senior, the first one that is going to be an architect in the zone. So it's like, right now you have competence, basically. So it's a very, very good position right now.

 And yes, take the opportunity. I think that you can learn a lot here at Goesium. And as I told you in detail, every project it's like a different it's like a change the company you have new people from the same uh company from gostm people that you never worked with before and you have new customers new client yes yeah so it's it's very dynamic you never will feel that like you are in a boring job that doing the same every time it's not like that it's always changing so be prepared my friend yes yeah it's a a nice challenge.

 I mean, my personal experience has been really good and as I told you, it gave me the opportunity to live in Spain as well and so on. So maybe in the future you can take this opportunity if you like it and if you apply it and you have the conditions. So yes, I think that not many jobs give you this opportunity. Working on English is also a huge advantage for sure. It's going to open the door for you.

 So you have a long way to go on GoSCM to keep you entertained and to feel that you are learning, progressing. So opportunities are not going to be lacking here. You will have a lot of opportunities. So yeah, hope that you feel the same way. But let's see how it develops. All right, man. That's it for today. Let's meet probably on Thursday. Let's have the second meeting. All right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thursday? Yes.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I will send you the invite.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. All right, man.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye!
