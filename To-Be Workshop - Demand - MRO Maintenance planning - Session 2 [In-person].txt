Um right now we're going to continue. Uh we're going to go over the preventative maintenance demand plan. Um. So to, uh, two key things from the workshop this morning. We recognize there is a gap In order to mitigate that gap or to give you options, what we need to do is we're going to have more of a technical conversation to understand better what data points we need to gather and how this will be done.\n\n I just want to go over normally what the leading practice is that you create and you update your maintenance plan in SAP IBP. This data will be then transferred to, sorry, in S4 HANA. This data will be then transferred to IBP. The maintenance plan will review it, and then we'll then follow the corrective maintenance plan where we consolidate, we have that meeting, we have that agreement between all parties, and then we move on to inventory planning and supply planning.\n\n Now, this is not happening at AdNoc. Recognize that? So this will likely change. This is just showing you the leading practice. So this will likely change. So we need to just more have a, before we recommend you the option with the process, we need to better understand the data points."},{"start_time":1728551496126,"end_time":1728551500457,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yeah.

In the technical session, we'll like to understand how the data is there in SAP S4 today. While we extract some data, but let's have with this clear understanding. Then probably we would like to extract some sample data and see, try to model it in IVP is how we can use the data, whether it will serve the purpose we're trying to serve before we say that this is how we will do.\n\n In the meantime, for sure, it is a gap on best practice as well, where from a maintenance perspective, we are not capturing the data where it is supposed to be. So that separate conversation, and if we have a workaround, what are the risks associated with those workaround has to be clearly called out so that a proper decision can be taken by ADNOC and how we want to proceed. Considering that this is the gap, this is the possible solution and what is the short-term plan as part of the implementation and what can the large long-term plan where probably you guys rework on your maintenance plan if possible and come up with a more standard way of doing things across AGCs.\n\n That's something we can conclude this discussion around the maintenance plans so that we can have a follow-up discussion around it while on high level the process Essentially remains the same where you have a data stream which is corrective. You have a data stream which is preventive. Both of them merge at a demand meeting and we have a demand which goes into inventory and supply.

If it is regularly consumed, which means that it should not be in a lot of stock, and the moment it gets consumed, it will reorder to a certain level.\n\n So essentially what you're saying is right, but we don't expect such parts to be part of such transactions, and the value is low, why would you move a low-value item from one GCC to other GCC? Just because there is stock available. And even if you do this reorder point planning, IBP is going to look at the stock, and IBP is going to set the reorder point in a way so that when you run this process, if reorder point is correctly set, over the period of time, the inventory will optimize to the new reorder point.\n\n If you have more inventory, if you have less reorder point, purchase requisition for next six months, one year, unless the inventory is consumed. And then eventually the stock comes down to the level of what you want. So it's not that we are not going to optimize inventory. It's not that it will not lead to stock piling at one location and stock less at other location. It's just that these are low value items.\n\n It will make sense more to buy and replenish locally rather than stock transferring from a different location.

So if somebody is giving this data and the material we procure and he's saying I will use after two years, he will not use it, he will be questionable.\n\n So nobody will take this accountability because the people are not, you can say, are having the authority to decide that. Some technical person has to decide or OEM has to recover. Then whatever OEM would recommend, people will follow them blindly. And that will also increase the inventory cost, because OEM want to sell this product. So you will give more consumption patterns."},{"start_time":1728553893097,"end_time":1728553893278,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yeah."},{"start_time":1728553893518,"end_time":1728553902062,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"I mean, I understand in that regard, we have a gap to define the reference material.

So we've looked at the preventive maintenance process. Process. We looked at the new spare part introduction from a process perspective. These three processes were in scope for today's discussion.\n\n Now let's utilize this time to talk about some of the other important parameters like how segmentations will happen in IBP so that we can discuss about those. The demand classification and segmentation is an important thing we would like to discuss and review with everyone. So these are the details steps of the processes.

The benefit of this is to first improve accuracy, and then efficiency and scalability. Why is that?\n\n Because you have massive amount of spare parts, so we need to be very careful with the use of the resources of the system. Based on that, we can basically store this information in an attribute. You will be able to see this product, this material has a continuous, pattern, this one is intermittent, and based on that we apply the right forecast model as I just mentioned."},{"start_time":1728554055634,"end_time":1728554056895,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Now the segmentation."},{"start_time":1728554058076,"end_time":1728554288224,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 9"},"words":"Thanks, Blastin, for covering this demand segmentation part. On this slide what we are trying to discuss is the different type of material segmentation which following and apart from that what are the additional segmentation from an IBP implementation perspective which should come up. First of all what is mass material segmentation? So material segmentation is we are trying to segregate the material in different buckets based on their behavioral patterns.\n\n From behavioral pattern what we understand we can say like the consumption value the parameters can be the frequency of consumption which is a movement-related parameter. Other things like the cost-related parameters, which is the actual unit price or unit cost of that particular spare part, their holding value. And again, on the criticality basis, we can further segment the modules. If we look at the different segmentation which AdNoc is following nowadays, we can see there are six different types of segmentation in that particular slide.\n\n The top fives are the ones which is typically being implemented by or even calculated by AdNoc nowadays. The bottom one, which is the lead time segmentation, is an additional parameter of the segmentation which is required from the IBP implementation perspective. I will cover each and every segmentation one by one. The very first segmentation is the ABC segmentation. Based on the consumption value.\n\n And the logic for segmenting this is that the top 70% of the volumes are categorized as A, the middle B, 20% and the bottom the 20% value is the C. Second one is the similar logic can be replicated in the IVP. And this type of segmentation can be used in the demand planning, inventory planning, and a supply planning model. The second classification is the FMSN, which is based on the movement. Again, the logic is that for fast moving, we say at least twice a year is the usage.\n\n Medium usage is that at least once in three years. And slow moving parts are like once they have used in the time horizon of three to five years. And if the item is lying in our inventory for more than five years, it's categorized as the non-moving item. Similar logic can be replicated in the IBP module and this classification can be used in the inventory planning and the supply plan module. Third segmentation is the XYZ segmentation.\n\n Here we are trying to use the stock holding value to further segment the materials which are lying in our stock and the logic is the top 70 percentile is considered as the X, the middle 20 percent is the Y and the the bottom 10 percentile is categorized as Z. Similar logic can be replicated in IBP. Again, this will be helpful in the inventory of planning module. Fourth one is the HML classification.\n\n This is particularly and particularly based on the unit price of the material. Here, we have used the criteria like if the item value is more than 10,000 dirham and it's contributing to almost percentile or top 70 percentile of the value which we are seeing then it's considered as the high. The middle one is the next 20 percentile and the typical range is 2.5k to 10k dirhams and if it's less than 2.5k then it's considered as the low.\n\n Typically these type of segmentation can be used in the inventory planning and the supply planning modules."},{"start_time":1728554289925,"end_time":1728554315844,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"The fifth one is When you say that you will be, you say that it can be configured to be calculated in IDP.

Again, one of the things that we want to understand is the effort that you are dedicating to all of this that can be automated by IVP. One of the main functionalities of IVP is to calculate segmentations. One of the basic ones is the Pareto distribution that you will see on the ABC, XYZ here, and many of the others can be replicated as well. So most of what you are seeing here can be calculated on IVP based on the data that the system is going to have.\n\n Now the question is, is that something that we want to automate on IVP? Because we know that you have most of this information on SAP, but is this being calculated on SAP? We understand that is not the case.

I think that they are two different discussions. How we define the parameters, that's one of them. For example, if you have ABC, the question is how we define A, B and C.

So automatically would calculate A, B, and C if you want to go that way.\n\n That is one option. And what you are saying, Marwan, I think that is related to the decision matrix that we are going to use later for inventory model selection to the service level selection and so on. So yes, that is going to be part. It's going to be based on the same segmentation, but it's more in the discussion of the inventory sessions that we are having later, okay? So, basically that. On the demand side, we also want to use segmentations and we need to understand the purpose.\n\n The purpose here, for example, when we say that demand planning can use ABC and can use BED is that when we are generating forecast on IDD, we know that the scope that we have is a lot. We are talking about millions and millions of combinations. So, where I need to focus because I'm not going to be able to focus on every combination. That is impossible. So that's why we need to use segmentation to understand the critical segments where we need to review and discuss.\n\n So for us that is ABC and that probably is BED that are telling you in a way what is the criticality of the item or location going Did I answer any of these questions that you were having?"},{"start_time":1728555494399,"end_time":1728555519557,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Is based on conception value or frequency of conception.

Let's check and you can give us your feedback. I'm overwhelmed if we need to come back with something more elaborated. What we were planning is to show you very quickly a little demo that we are doing here on the system. We are trying to get information related to your parts, related to your companies, and so on. This is information that we are having on the system.\n\n The data that you're seeing right now here is fictitious because we wanted to communicate a story and then we needed to provide values that were able to do that. So here what you have is by part and plant, you have all the historical usage of that specific combination. So the system, what it does is automatically calculate, for example, the demand pattern. This is done automatically, and for your statistical forecast, it's going to be based on this.\n\n It's going to discard many of the models. For a statistical forecasting, can use many algorithms, but a first layer of filtering which ones are going to be the ones that you are going to use for forecasting is by using the segmentation. What Bastian was explaining on the last session, for example, if you know that the demand is continuous, then why you are going to use an intermittent algorithm? So, you don't want to spend time on that.\n\n You want to use only algorithms that are able to forecast this kind of things. So, this is something that the system is going to generate automatically and also it's going to use automatically. You don't need to do anything about it. It's just a machine learning to drive a better statistical focus. Something similar is going to happen with other segmentation like ABC. This can be fairly automated on the system.\n\n So in which we are going, in what measure we are going to base ABC is something that we need to discuss and we are already doing it. That probably value and frequency are better drivers of the importance than the value itself, okay? So we can use this segmentation here, right? And whenever we are reviewing the statistical forecast, let me jump to the other tab. So here you are reading on a statistical forecast based on the history, right?\n\n So the question is that now that you need to review the numbers that the system is providing, where do you need to focus? So you want to focus on this segment. So you are in the Excel, in the planning view, and you have many combinations. You have A combinations, you have B combinations, you have C combinations. What we are saying to you is that you shouldn't focus here. So when you are reviewing the numbers, would be a waste of time to check these combinations because they are not really important and they are not affecting you in a great way.\n\n In the other way around, the A combinations, they are really important. If you don't focus and we give you a bad number and nobody's checking this, this can have a big impact on the operations. So you need to focus on the critical items. We can define that based on ABC segmentations that are Pareto distributions, not only that. We can drive this based on the BTE segmentation as well that is telling you what's and this way you are reducing the scope of what you need to review and when you go to the meetings where you are going to discuss the number at high level you also need to focus on these segments because you know that they are important and you need to check on that.\n\n Does that make sense that that explanation?"},{"start_time":1728556168116,"end_time":1728556236663,"speaker":{"name":"Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC)"},"words":"Yeah that's clear so the most probably if you see then the reality what will happen the the a number of items it will be very minimal because the top high consumption it will be complete the 70% by maybe within 100 items. So that's reason. So we want to like think loudly so maybe we can do one more session on this. This finally we see now another question. Now see do we have like sensitivity on the sourcing part of it?\n\n Example if you go back to the slide so for the like the segmentation whenever you move to the supply planning so like severity on the sourcing for example it's locally available it's like coming from overseas or rather than the lead time so there are possibility which is available here within the country or something like that and maybe the load time lead time is high so do we have any other kind of of classification for the sourcing other than this were recommended.\n\n Also, do we have any best practice under the segmentation?"},{"start_time":1728556237063,"end_time":1728556240766,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"We have domestic export, right?

There is a second option where the system we just highlighted will generate an alert saying, look at this. This looks weird. It looks strange. So take a look and correct if you think this is not a part of the consumption history, but more like an exception. But then we have other examples. When we have, for example, very seasonal patterns. So here, this is a raw history of consumption pattern.\n\n And we can see we have some peaks and some valleys. So are these really outliers? Well, for that, we have the machine learning that will detect first the consumption patterns. Because it is an example, we can say this is a seasonal thing. This is a seasonal peak. It has nothing to do with the library. So in that case, the system won't recommend, won't make any correction, and it won't even generate an alert.\n\n It will say, no, this is just a seasonal peak. So in this case, it's very useful because we're able to differentiate what is complete, what is a complete, outrageous value, weird value, in the first example. In the second example, we have seasonal, but could be different cases. In this case, it was seasonal, but could be also intermittent demand, which I think is your situation in most of the cases, where you have unspiking consumption in a year, and then you have no consumption over the last few few months, even a couple of years.\n\n So that, of course, being like a consistent pattern of intermittent demand over a few months or even a few years won't be considered an outlier because it's just the pattern.

Let me make it maybe a little bigger. I'm going to hide the chart. We are making this too big. So, the idea is that This is a fake example, of course. We wanted to show. Can you see a graph in the system? Yeah, you can see it, for sure. So you have Excel charts, and then you can also have on the web, you can have some charts, and you can have some alerts related to this. This is just a simple example of filter filtering something.\n\n Yeah. So let me just filter to focus the example on this. It will be much easier. Yes, we can configure many things to bring this into visibility. So that's important part. What the system is doing is taking the information that we have historically, and we calculate the normality range. So it will note what are the normal values, and they are between a range, upper and lower. So whatever is outside is going to be identified as an outlier.\n\n In this case, we have this number that is fictitiously high, but you know that can be reason for this. The algorithm can run automatically in the background and can provide you a better number based on a mean average or if this seasonality will try to smooth and provide you a reasonable number. Because if you are in a peak, you don't want to replace with the average, of course. You want a similar number.\n\n All of this can be done by a system. It's going to use as an input the amount pattern recognition that we were showing. For seasonality, if you have something like seasonality, it will take care of that and will cleanse appropriately. For us, decision later when we see the data is that if we want to use the system proposals or if you just want to use the alerts like this one and to bring this into attention.\n\n This is just one example in which you have the history, the system proposal. Then you also can have a manual input. So you can override this. You can say, no, this number should be more similar to 100, because the planner has experience. They know what are the normal numbers. So this will be a correction. Of course, the final number will be whatever the planner is saying. It's always going to be like that.\n\n In every result that the system is providing, it's a proposal. But the final word is going to be from the planner. The planner decides if this is a number that makes This is also going to be driven by the segmentation, of course. Probably we have many, many alerts. Probably the less critical combination we want to leave it to the system to decide by itself, the critical ones we want to check. So that's why we push with segmentation because we know that there are specific combinations where we need to put an eye on.\n\n So yeah, that's the idea. So the statistical forecast support will be based on this number, not on this number, because it's not fixed. We are not saying that this is not going to happen again. What we are saying that it's a futile exercise to try to predict something very exceptional by nature. It doesn't make sense. We want to forecast what is normal, not what is an exception. We are going to fail on that, and we are going to get a big PR that doesn't make sense, right?\n\n"},{"start_time":1728557248298,"end_time":1728557258982,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So any questions on this?

Like the best practice indicates three principles. The first one, and then you probably know this very well, is that it is easier to forecast. Sooner periods then. Periods that are way too in the future, right? It is way easier to forecast what is going to happen in the next month than what is going to happen in a year or two.\n\n The second principle is that it is easier to forecast at a higher level, at an aggregated level than a disaggregated level. So probably you will be able to say in a very accurate way how many spare parts you would next year, then what is going to be the consumption or a specific part in a specific month next year, right? And the third principle is that any forecast, even the most accurate one, has an error in it, and we need to liquidate.\n\n That's why we have inventory safety stock, because we know there will situation changes all the time, so we need to be prepared for that. You need to always keep these three principles in mind when reviewing the statistical forecast. The system, of course, we already cover some of these examples and we will have specific session to cover a little bit more of the technical part. Review more in full detail how the system calculates these different methods.\n\n But based on the consumption patterns that you have informed to us, we think that the models that are highlighted in blue are the ones more appropriate to your consumption patterns, which are the copy past periods. For example, you have certain consumption over the last year, so we the exact same pattern to the next year. Then cross-zone method and cross-zone TSV method. These are models based on probability of consumption or not consumption, so maybe over, I don't know, three months you have no consumption, then you have one consumption, then follow of four periods without consumption, and so on and so forth.\n\n The cross on TSV is pretty similar."},{"start_time":1728557895065,"end_time":1728557988351,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"I don't want to go through all the different ones, otherwise this session would be endless. But the important part is that based on what I explained in the beginning about the demand pattern recognition, the system will automatically run the right model for the right combination. We also, of course, have different models for different consumption patterns. The single exponential is like an average, basically, for combinations that have a continuous pattern.\n\n Double exponential smoothing is something that considers the average, and on top of that, considers a trend. Would be upwards or downwards. And the triple exponential takes into consideration also seasonal behaviour, which of course can be related to the weather, right, to the different stations. I think we can move into the next one. So how the system works. First, it analyses the historical and detects a pattern.\n\n So in this case, we have a seasonal pattern, a cycle that repeats over and over, and then it replicates to the future. That's what we have here. That is the principle that the forecast is following."},{"start_time":1728557994575,"end_time":1728558020264,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"So again, this is going to be applied to corrective maintenance. For preventing maintenance, it's not something that needs to be forecasted with these kind of models because it will come from the plans and how we adapt the data to have an accurate consumption. This is just for corrective maintenance."},{"start_time":1728558024435,"end_time":1728558305589,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"It's a long one. So we are going to check it offline then. So all that Bastian is saying on the system is very transparent, let's say. The idea is that these models are going to be fairly automatic. Either way, we want you to know that there are many algorithms that the system is deciding by itself. It's using the information that we said about the demand pattern. It's part of one of the inputs, so it takes the best decision But for us, it looks very simple, because we will have the history after cleansing it, of course, after removing the outliers and data that is not going to give us a good number in the future.\n\n So we get what is normal in the system, and then we try to replicate that pattern. So if this behaves intermittently, the idea is that we get an intermittent forecast. If this is continuing, we need to get a continuous forecast. But here, for example, you have an intermittent pattern, I think. No, that is not a good example. What we have here are continuous pattern, right? So every month, you see that you are getting some number.\n\n Maybe for some parts, for consumer, we'll say this can be the case. And then the system is proposing something that, in this case, is kind of an average because it's very stable, right? In the case that it's not, it's going to provide something different. Here, you see that. Have a little variation in the numbers, so it's that they are not very similar, and sometimes you don't have a consumption pattern and the system will try to forecast something similar.\n\n So you know that sometimes you are missing data because of the behavior and so on. And the similar case will be with when you have any, for example, intermittency, would try to get like a common number, like the base CS probably is going to be like a flat number, but it will calculate intermittence of that, and whatever additional variability is going to be covered by the safety stuff that we calculate later.\n\n So this number is something that will be generated automatically on the system on a monthly basis. That is the normal practice. It's something that we can schedule, or it's something that the planner can just press a button and run the algorithm. It's just that the matter is deciding when we need to update the number. Because if you have a planning, maybe you want to wait to have the meetings to discuss a number, and you don't want to change this automatically because otherwise all the base that you are discussing is going to change as well.\n\n So usually the best practice for us is that the planner decides when to run this in a specific date of the month, of course. Then what can happen is that if the numbers that the system is providing, that updates automatically this line, doesn't make sense. You always have the opportunity to overwrite. So let's put whatever number is just for example. Whatever number you put is going to take hierarchy over the last number and it's going to be the final number that we release for supply planning and so on.\n\n So this is the idea. This adjustment that you see is just a simple logic in which we overwrite. We think that this is a best practice because when the planner is putting this number is they're taking accountability as well of the whole number. But there can be also other practices like if you want to adjust maybe not for the whole number but maybe a delta and then the latest number can be assumed or in this case the subtraction that can be configured.\n\n If you want this to be a percentage that can also be a guess something like this if I think if I can be quick is increased by 10 percent and you get the number as well. Whatever is better for you and make easier to put a number on the system so we can take it into consideration. So that is part of the business intelligence that we are bringing. The model is going to take you see to the consumption patterns and try to get a better number.\n\n But sometimes the planners, they know more information about the behavior than we know. So it's good to have also that intelligence into the final number. So that's the idea. As I say before, we have many combinations. So probably many of them are going to be fairly automatic, depending on the criticality. And the others are going to need some supervision by the planners. So we make sure that the critical parts, at least, we are getting a very, very reasonable number that everyone is comfortable with.\n\n Yeah, basically that. I don't know if there is any question related to this."},{"start_time":1728558306891,"end_time":1728558339678,"speaker":{"name":"Achmad Sonhaji (Borouge)"},"words":"This one. I have a question.

That's one important, but that's the last thing we would like to discuss as part of this session to make sure the process we are proposing how it will. So generally at the best practice in any large organization there is something called planning calendar.\n\n So as a best practice, our proposal is to have a planning plan calendar and then use this planning calendar as a reference for executing our process in every month. So you will have a monthly planning cycle. In the monthly planning cycle, the activities will be broken in the weeks. And then based upon in which week we are, everyone is supposed to have that activity executed in a sequence so that you can utilize the tool to the maximum potential, which means that When it comes to demand, the planning calendar starts with identifying demand, making sure the demand is correct, forecasting all the things, and finalizing the demand, which then gets input for inventory and supply planning.\n\n So generally, the supply planning is the last piece, which is happening at the last end of the month, last week of the month, where every input is clearly discussed, identified, agreed, and then based upon that, the supply proposal is reviewed and then the supply proposal finally agreed between all the stakeholders and published as the proposal for the month of for the specific planning month and the cycle repeats every month.\n\n So as a best practice for MRO planning this is the proposal from our side to have to adopt this such planning calendar so that activities across agencies can be be planned in parallel, synchronized, aggregated at NOC level, and then leads into inventory and supply planning.

First, make sure that we have the right data in IVP and then send to S4 instead of making mistakes.\n\n I think the discussion is that from a historical perspective, why you want to come back if you change the parameters, discussing if we can come back to the previous value if this is wrong."},{"start_time":1728560471057,"end_time":1728560480739,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yes, okay, got it.

We've shared how the data gets extracted from S4ANAP into IBP, what happens to it, looking at it from a segmentation perspective, looking at it from a classification perspective. Then based upon that, what are the pre-processing steps? What are the forecasting activities?\n\n And based after forecast, what are the activities along with demand consistency driving demand for maintenance planning. We also looked at the new part process and how the new part process integrates with the overall planning process. So in principle, and then the proposal of having a planning calendar, which makes sure that all the activities are in sync. While on a process level, I think we have an agreement on how this process should look like, And this takes care of our equipment.\n\n We've identified specifically on the roles and responsibilities which are more organizational in nature. Data for our preventive mentors, how to make that accurate data. We see that there is a gap with respect to where the data is maintained today in S4ANA versus what IVP needs. We also have a gap on new product on identifying similar models and how to identify the similar models. Also, we've discussed about the critical items from an equipment side, how that criticality of an equipment can be associated to the lower components of the bomb so that that criticality can be used in segmentation.\n\n So that's something. So these are some of the points which will need follow-up discussion. For sure, from a data perspective, we do have follow-up sessions on technical side. But then we need follow-up sessions to discuss some of the organizational limits so that we can, based upon the roles AdNoc has, we can define a final process, the roles and responsibilities and activities of the demand planning.\n\n And then it can also update the planning calendar with the roles and responsibilities.

And then there will be discussion around what should be the 2B process based upon the inputs we have discussed in alignment to ad hoc needs.\n\n We will come back and say what things are possible. So it may happen that from a tool perspective, 2B process, some of the gaps may not possible. I'm not saying that's the fact, but I'm just giving you an idea that we will look at all the gaps, see how we can provide solution to those gaps and with those solution to the gaps, how the current proposed process to be processing change and the final preview process would be shared to the team for decision making.\n\n"},{"start_time":1728560731957,"end_time":1728560733398,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"I hope that answers your question."},{"start_time":1728560734858,"end_time":1728560735238,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Thank you."},{"start_time":1728560739180,"end_time":1728560744062,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Well then thank you very much for your time today.
