Good morning, Nishant. How are you? Great, great. Yeah, Nishant, the firewall ticket did you? That was cancelled and I think there are multiple reasons.

One is CIDS side and one is on DSA side. So he suggested that let us wait for a firewall ticket to approve SDD so that we can do it together in a team's call. So that is the latest update which we have from Kaiser. So currently we are waiting for approval.

We have two follow up actions, one for Nishant to help us get this for access to Buruj through the firewall setup and then second is once the STD approval completes. A firewall setup is done, then we need to do the CIDS and DSA system configuration with infrastructure team. So Nishant, we'll have to do this with the Buruj systems as well. So Kaiser will do it for AdNoc.\n\n So for Buruj, it will be you and Anandha? Yes. So let's have the same call for all of us, both Buruj and Adnog.
