UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, everyone. Hello.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Good evening. Let's give Raoul Naamani a few minutes to join, and then we'll start. You Guys, I'll let Mohamed summarize the STIRCO once he joins, but in the meantime, instead of going through our list as usual and spending most of the call on line items, let's go around the table and each one of you is tackling separate issues. So I'll ask each one to provide an update and additional risks if some have been identified.

 So, Raoul, maybe you can kick us off with the conversations that you've been having with with Khalid. Then we will follow it up with Kunal and the whole STD story.

Patel, Rahul:
There are a few items open with Khalid. One is the plugin. Plugin is still pushing. We are still not able to get through, but then he's still pushing. The thing with plugin is that once the approval approves it it goes to the next level and we get we identify the next set of people so we're hoping this is the last one but we don't know for sure yet so that's the gray area in the full process of the plugin so that's what colin is pushing and that's the update we have on the drilling that's the uh the excel story you know correct excel plugin okay so

Roumanos, Hadi:
just to give everybody a heads up we um discussed several of the options with Khaled today, so either everyone's on site and we're doing sort of a hands-on UUT over the next week, or it's a remote UUT but people have access through their laptops, which is also a half-decent sort of way forward, or the worst option, which is three, where it's remote and as don't have access on their laptops. So that's what we're trying to push for per Rahul's comment.

 Anything else?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, additionally on the drilling, based upon the discussion in alignment with leadership, we've internally aligned between KPMG and GovCM team and what are the next steps. In short, the next step is we will re-evaluate the process and the solution based upon this new kind guidance on connecting with DLIN EWDP system. And based upon that, hopefully early next week we'll be able to close on the process for DLIN.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. OK.

Patel, Rahul:
So the current points which we have identified in DLIN. It's 55. So we can close the current. Let me work with Tara or with you tomorrow. Rewrite the drilling open item because the current points identified were risk with respect to current process and all that those are mitigated with the Adnox leadership's today's input which means we need to now put up different action items based

Roumanos, Hadi:
upon the current discussion. Tara is in training tomorrow and Thursday so that's for you Rocio to know as well. I'll be the main point of contact until that's done so you and thank you so just to make sure that no emails are unanswered so in case you have any support needed from PMO I'm the main point of contact or Raoul in case I'm ignoring you.

Patel, Rahul:
We still don't have Muhammad. He just suggested that he'll be joining soon but he's still on the so today we were having a call with Mustafa and the SAP CST so they have performed certain activities now Sagar has requested Mustafa to provide the client

Sheth, Kunal:
certificate so that he can complete the pending SNC activity so we are already on it so on day-to-day basis as we are following with the Kaiser as well as Mustafa to complete the SDD activity.

Roumanos, Hadi:
A question, is there a reason why this is taking days instead of hours? So is the amount of work that's needed justify the fact that we're now a week into the process, if not more? And every day that goes by, we get a small update instead of it being resolved. I'm just asking because I'll give you a bit of context, right? So we just finished, we just finished the circle today where the leadership is basically telling us what do you guys want us to do to make this go faster?

 Right? So we have the full support of their leadership to make things move quicker. So for me, that's as the D is one example, right? Because every passing day we get an update that someone's on it or that a ticket or that so when in reality if you put everybody in the room for two hours it should get resolved that there's no there's no effort associated with this it's just a process and the process that's taking too long i've had the conversation with khaled today I told him we'll send an email following this circle saying that that's the leadership's direction to move faster that's the sort of um um go ahead Or green light from the leadership to expedite as much as possible and pilot can use this as a leverage to send to the different Decision makers or gates that are holding up as DD.

 That's one example Right. So for me, it's not it's not a matter of a week, right? It's a matter of a morning.

Sheth, Kunal:
Mm-hmm Yeah, I agree, but the problem is that there are multiple stakeholders involved, like Mustafa and Kaiser from AdNoc plus from the cloud team. It's a SAP CS team. They are working on it. So that is the reason. No, no, I agree. I agree.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right.

Roumanos, Hadi:
But when you tell me they're working on it, is there actual work to be done or Is it just a matter of 10 people approving?

Sheth, Kunal:
No, the problem is that after doing the multiple follow-up Sagar morning, then evening also did the follow-up with the Mustafa, still we are awaiting client certificate so that Sagar can also complete their activity. So after doing the follow-up, we are not getting the output. So that is also one of the reason why we are having a delay. Let me ask you something.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let me ask you something. And that's for my knowledge, because maybe I'm ignorant in the topic. Is there actual work that needs to be done? Does someone need to spend six hours working on code to get it done?

Naamani, Mohamad:
It's not as simple as that they need to do work. Reviewing is what they work. So they check, is this compliant with the rules? Does it cause any threat? So what we've been dealing with this before is now part two, whether it's related to authentication, it's related to how it's added to the landscape. Correct me if I'm wrong, Kunal and Tim. So yes, there is work but not in like someone is doing an actual Yes, and and that's the nature of the beast now I understand that and this is why we're trying to get from Khalid Okay, can we have it like last time?

 We had a list of five people who should approve and we were trying to push for a date Here, I think on all the best we can do is just to understand how many approvers we still have That's that that's the the best we can do and And yes, they're saying, what do you need? But that was more from the business. For digital, we need to follow suit, saying, OK, we need a hotline. Those things cannot just take for this project exactly like they take for other projects.

 I'll stop here so that we can move to.

Roumanos, Hadi:
And I understand, Kunal, it's not up to you. It needs to be something that Khaled pushes from his side, knowing that there is this mandate from the leadership, which we're trying to drive from our side. But you can always use it as an excuse. Once you see that email from us on the summary of the Steelco and the decisions, you can use it with whoever you're talking to say, hey, but by the way, I know that the Steelco blah, blah, blah.

 So why can't you give it to me today instead of tomorrow? Something along those lines. But Khaled should drive that communication to try and make things go faster.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I'll close here. Have you covered the Excel add-on? Because I have a comment on it. We covered it, so if you want to add a comment, go ahead. Yes, because basically using the same logic, because mainly the business SVP today said, we'd like to expedite, tell us what's required, at least from his mandate. The people, which is good, which at least for now, especially for Bassi and Hector, Raoul, the people, the team, working with the key users, it's good.

 Because if we need, so we're telling them we need confirmation of their attendance, we need them to be engaged, we need to do this. However, for this session next week, having them on site is a slim chance, at least for next week. And Khaled said, I mean, we had the discussion after. So it's not going to be that easy. We're pushing for this, it might not happen this time, maybe the week after, but we're trying to make sure it happens, for example, SITU80.

 Now, definitely, you would say they're saying we need support, but things might not go as fast, and the reason I'm saying this is the following. If they come, let's say we push and they all come, we don't have the facility, and that's what I mentioned, explained yesterday to Bastian after we extended the call, The different rooms that they have are only like the room you were in. So we tried, so we have a laptop of Raoul and Koushbo is trying to set up her laptop, but we will not have enough laptops, unfortunately, not to mention that our laptops should not be used by other than KPMG resources.

 So we will cannot replicate that each person is using his or her machine for the training, which means the following. Ideally, during SIT UAT, we'll plan from now, and it will be a training room where there will be machines ready for every person, everything set up on it, so on and so forth. For this one, we need to live with each person is attending remotely, except if there are a couple of them that came with their laptop.

 So remotely, or they came with their own laptops. And we are pushing based on today's tier code to have the Excel add-on available ASAP, which means over the next few days, we will see how much of this will happen. Now, as a plan B, we might be able to have those three or four laptops from KPMG, and instead of basically their own laptops, we can tell them, look, we're sharing our screen. Let's try your script.

 We can drive, you can see it. It's not ideal, but it's not possible for us to allow anyone to touch a KPMG laptop. That's the issue. And if they're coming on site, there is no facility to do this. So even to our benefit, having them behind their own desk is better. And we were pushing for the add-on to basically to be installed. Is that too confusing or it's clear? Because also I would like to discuss the travel based on this.

 Because if all of them would be remote next week, other than us talking to each other, and the trip will cost us like $10,000 collectively, I don't see a value unless we need to do this or prepare for SIT. Let me stop here. Clarification, objections, agreement, before we move to another topic. First, is it clear what I mentioned? Constraints because we don't have a training facility to start with at this point.



Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, the situation is very clear. OK, are we OK in this case that travel?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Although I would be happy to see you team, don't get me wrong, but it's not going to add any benefit because it all of them will be better off if they're working behind their desks so that they'll have the laptop and Excel. I don't. Any objection Bastian and because I know Bastian and Hector are traveling.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No. Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
No, we only were discussing about the time zone that maybe if we are having the time zone, I mean, if we are starting the sessions all the days at seven, that will be a problem. So maybe I will check with Tara the schedule just to be sure that not every But if we have to do it, then we will discuss it internally, there is no problem.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I think because we're following their time and the reason for this is we want to make sure we have two sessions per day, which means one should be before noon or yeah, noonish and the other after. That's why we have to do those two sessions, unfortunately.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay. Okay. And then I will check with Valdivia also the cost of rescheduling. The trip, and I will let you know.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, Tara, if you write this down, let us talk to Valdivia, not even an email, Tara, tomorrow, just to tell her because of 123, we might need to do cancellation. Let us handle this, Rocio, so that she understands it's because of us or Adnok. We'll take this from your plate. It could be rescheduling or it could be cancellation. We'll see, but at least we'll give Valdivia a heads up tomorrow saying that's the situation.

 If everyone is remote, it doesn't make sense.

Bastian Osorio:
I believe it's better to cancel theirs because we don't know if we're going to rebook the hotel.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, you're right. I'm being optimistic. We don't know. Yeah, I'm being optimistic. And not next week, the one after. And Tara, this is also on your plate. If by then, instead of the rooms, booked, they would have a training room available. But the reason this is not confirmed is this training room with laptops and then also install the Excel add-ons instead of the actual users might not be possible.

 Again, that's why I'm saying for SIT or AT we need to start from now because all of those logistics will take time. So yes, we'll talk tomorrow to Valdivia saying there's a cancellation or rescheduling. And I think we can manage the penalty.

Bastian Osorio:
But when are we going to know if it's one or the other? Because if we rebook for, let's say, two weeks, then we need to plan that trip.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, right now you have a trip booked for next week and returning end of week after, right? Yeah, we do. Exactly. And you checked if you can cancel for penalty instead of, so it's cancellation versus rescheduling. Is there a difference in penalties? I have no idea.

Bastian Osorio:
I need to check. Yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
If you can check this and then as early as tomorrow noon, let's do on chat on the June chat, we'll confirm. As I said, most probably it will be canceling, except for one case. Do we know after this? When is the next time we need to be here? It's SIT logically, right? So when is the next logical trip beyond this?

Rocio Minguillon:
I think it's UIT, not SIT.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Tara, remember the four weeks schedule and remember the line item in that schedule that says this is the logistics for our team and GoSCM. This should allow us to answer this question. In 10 seconds instead of...

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, no, the answer is no, that we don't, we were not planning to travel on SIT, we were planning to travel on UT and UIT. That was the plan and we don't have, in that four weeks, we don't have like...

Naamani, Mohamad:
Which means, Sebastian, cancelling might be better now because the exact date of the UAT and the rooms, it all depends on on the progress of UT, on SIT, et cetera. I hope we'll be on time, but rather than also book and change, let's cancel and move on. You can just double check from your side that canceling versus rescheduling of tickets.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I'll check.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Mohamed, we lost you.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, I was saying, just double check by saying that there's no difference between cancellation and rescheduling, it's the same fee charge, then in that case you can cancel. We can proceed with this, okay, given how far the next trip is. And Tara will talk to Valdivia just to make sure also we don't get penalized.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Actually, back to you. I want to give the entire team sort of a brief summary of the circle, just because most of the team weren't with us.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Maybe key highlights, key decisions. Yeah, I joined a bit late. Did you brief them on it? No, no, that's why we're waiting for you. Okay, brief highlights. So overall, it was a good discussion, especially since we had the SVP of business, not just the VP, interested in the solution. He highlighted the need for, he said, look, just help me with the executive board with one slide that talks about those key benefits and what do you achieve out of this?

 Not numbers, but basically this improves productivity, efficiency, this now makes the planning more streamlined, something like this, like a table that in each area, in demand, supply, demand, and if drilling et cetera, what do they get out of it? Which is something I think in the BPD we touched on those and we'll build it with you over the next day or so. So that's like, because they're saying we've invested in this, no one will say, will ask about the money, but will say, okay, what does it help us achieve?

 Which I think we have, and it's important because it means it's high on the exec board. It's not like a project, technical project where someone proceed will just proceed with. So this is more from visibility how high profile this project is. That's number one. Number two on the timeline because of this recent delay the SVP said look I barely managed to agree or to sell the overall timeline of June to the upper management because originally they wanted the April March if you remember.

 Now that we're talking about July and there might be also delays. Please, I need your help to contain this. Check what you can do to go back to June and also how we don't have any further delays and tell us what do you need from us. Doubles if more resources from the consultants or from the business if you need more dedicated time. That's why Hadi and I were referring to we're using this message to push.

 However, on the technical side, it's not that easy. He doesn't know this, but he said also to Mansouri, the VP who also attended this time, and Firas, saying we need to do whatever so that we can expedite this. I think without promising, we'll discuss. Also Khalid told me, can we check what we can do? I told him, look, if we're pushing, we need to push on the business team to join all the sessions and give approvals quickly, etc.

 And on the technical, to do the same what whenever we have the SDDs and the firewalls and all of the gates that we have. This is the key message that you need to be aware of We can use this also, it's everyone's benefit, not only us, because they're interested to expedite, which means any push or exceptions needed to make sure users are not only approving to Bastion, and yesterday Bastion mentioned, we'd like to engage with them the earliest.

 We even mentioned it, saying we're happy to do this, One support we need if you exclude all the mechanics of technical or logistics is we need everyone to hear from you that this is very important. So any session, they need to come fully focused, not distracted, make the max out of all sessions, and every move when we move from UT to SIT, SIT to UAT, that they are fully basically engaged so that we minimize time of back and forth.

 I didn't think that the solution will do this because I didn't attend previous session, etc. They said they're happy to do this. Again, this message needs to trickle down from the SVP and VP to their troops. But at least now we have that support. So we'll use it to the max. In parallel on the technical, we're also using that logic saying, okay, if business provided all the resources, we cannot be late with our technical approval that takes like five, six people, two weeks to approve a technical document or an architecture, etc.

 So that's what I mean by we're using this also to everyone's benefit. I think other than this, so that was most of the discussion, we definitely briefed them, we started build that we're doing more of an interactive or agile way of involving users so that they can see and believe the solution since it's a major question mark. And they said, again, we like this logic. Tell us how we can support. Maybe I went too fast.

 Tell me. No, no. One element is the timeline, Hamad.

Roumanos, Hadi:
So we need to figure this one out as we proceed, because they showed concern on the June versus July timeline. Which I mentioned at the beginning. So we need to work this with Khaled and manage it. Because everyone's aware that any single delay will push us even beyond July.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So we'll need to manage this with pilot and with the leadership as we progress. Yes. And for the team, because the idea now is not going to be like before and playing different permutations, etc. The idea is now how we can use this request again to all of our benefits in a way where now we re-baseline and we're moving, but still there are certain things that can delay us. We're trying to apply is how can we use this push from management to make sure that the next week, two weeks, three weeks, or the next few months, everyone is fully engaged and there is no potential risk of delay because of users not being involved, them not approving on time because they just think it's not priority, and the same technical team approving, reviewing, so let's call it a hotline for this.

 So maybe we'll consult with you that how we can, where are the things that we need to push from the business. So I might ask X, let's say, Basia or someone. We talked about engaging with the users. If I want to talk to Asma and we need to tell her, look, we need the following to be involved in those dates. Is it enough to have UT and UAT or we need earlier, et cetera. So this is more aligning with you on where do we need to push.

 Okay, Rinaldo, Kunal, team, what are the other things like SDD that we might hit a brick wall or even when we do SIT regression testing so we can ask them from now to have maybe a dedicated team or a high priority ticket so that they can always respond to us right now and Kunal can confirm the confirmation of an SDD for a project that is 1 million. Or 20 million is the same, which doesn't work when everyone from upper management is saying we need it ASAP.

 Again, this is, so everyone is in the loop. There is nothing at this point other than us aligning that we need to do extra or re-plan. It's basically spotting in the plan where there could be some optimizations. If we ask them, look, we assumed Sebastian with us? I don't think so. Sebastian, for example, and Bastian are both on the call. We said that this is assuming UAT will take three weeks, for example.

 We can tell them, look, if you're asking us, we can do it in two, but we want everyone's confirmation. We're not going to re-baseline the plan. We're not going to change, but we can go live earlier if everyone is basically serious and supporting. Something similar for technical let's say, SIT or regression. Guys, regression takes that much. We would like, are you filming me? Regression takes that long.

 We can expedite it and cut a few days, something like this. So we will need your brains. Nothing extra at this point to be done, but it's an opportunity that we can use to everyone's benefit. Any questions on this? I think it's good. It shows everyone is interested, so it will go ahead.

Sebastian Alba:
I understand, Mo. So the 10 requests that we presented is not confirmed, and we have to review and try to mitigate.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, no, it's confirmed from a timeline. It's confirmed? Confirmed from a timeline. So Hadi is working with the PMO on it. And Bastian, I know I owe you a response on the discussion, because basically, we will post it on the project. Service now and include in it an estimate of the cost. And then over the next few weeks, we'll discuss the cost more. This way, we confirm that the date is pushed. Otherwise, it will keep showing late, which everyone wouldn't like, But the idea is that push is accepted.

 They're saying, guys, how can we help you go live earlier? And it's actually, that's why I'm saying it's dual benefits. It will help us if we can manage telling them, look, We can go two days earlier or one week because of the following. This is number one. And the second is it will help us mitigate any potential delays, just like the ones we faced going forward. Because if we have a delay and we'll say, okay, guys, that's not what we agreed.

 Upper management is saying support, it means we need to go faster.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I hope I answered your question. Add a note on this Sebastian right now Tara is updating ServiceNow with the dates that you gave us right so we're still going with the June 23rd sorry Bella June 23rd and July 21st for wave one wave two respectively and that's what we're showing in the weekly update starting tomorrow okay now the conversation is if we can win time as we go great and if we're at risk of are being delayed, we start yelling that, hey, we have the support of the leadership, what can we do?



Naamani, Mohamad:
That's the gist of it. In other words, since we're changing the date, if we manage to go live earlier, everyone will be happy, no one will complain, and it won't be like they'll say, ah, no, no, you need to stay longer because that's what you said. It's actually the contrary. So that's how it works. We were talking to Sebastian, but Sebastian wasn't here. Fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Roumanos, Hadi:
We lost you for a minute, but I understood the message.

Sebastian Alba:
Yeah, yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And my last 10 seconds were, we'll stick to this new deadline. If we go live earlier, everyone will be happy. No one will say, no, why you did this? As you know, early is not perfect.

Sebastian Alba:
That's the basic scenario. We managed to cut time break, but that's the baseline.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And now we have the excuse to keep pushing everyone. Look, remember SVP what they said, what he said, we need to do this, etc.

Sebastian Alba:
So we'll use this to the max. Last administrative question, did they sign the closure of the design for the Wave 2 on ServiceNow?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yes, on the last email I saw from them they had approved everything. Whether actually they signed, I will let Raoul answer this. Is asking about milestone more on service now as opposed to the approval of the yeah I saw I saw the approval was okay but I'm not sure about no that's good enough we don't need it on service now like

Naamani, Mohamad:
the kickoff and the milestone this is this is different so moving forward approvals on emails is enough from an administrative perspective for us to invoice but I think milestone approval had this requires similar process like we've done for milestone one or no that's no that's what I'm no that's the answer I'm giving.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Any milestone beyond the first one doesn't require ServiceNow approval, it requires email approvals so that we can invoice.

Sebastian Alba:
Great, I'll tell Cesar to reach out for the more administrative process. So that's the confirmation I had from Khaled.

Roumanos, Hadi:
So right now, similar, so for instance, I'll give you an example, right? For milestone 2 for December, we had the approval Okay, we didn't go through the service now approval process, and that was fine.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And the same applies, excuse me, to milestone three, which is end of February. Yeah, by the way, Hadi, milestone three is for also wave one?

Bastian Osorio:
I need to confirm this.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay, because there is a milestone for the approval, just like we have approval of wave one design, which is milestone number two, after the first milestone, which is kickoff and et cetera. There is another milestone for wave two documents. Go ahead, Tara. No, I said the next milestone is wave two blueprint. Exactly, that's what I'm saying. And SDD, correct?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Which is end of Feb.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no, no.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Lala, without the SDD, Hadi. Oh, OK, hang on, hang on. Let me just validate this. Give me one second. There are two milestones to be paid with now.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So Hadi wave one and wave two for wave one. The blueprint is what was December 31st. You're right, you're right, yes, yes, to answer. Yes, let me make easier on everyone. Milestone one was common. It was a 10% kickoff. And a few things. Milestone 2 is designed for wave 1. Milestone 3 or regardless of the number. Wave 2 also we're done and we got the design documents approved. This is another so the first one is 8% and the second is 7.

 So 10 is the invoice we already issued. Now we have 8 plus 7. That we have the approval we need to process how to raise the invoice.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Deal?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Not yet.

Patel, Rahul:
Will we be raising a comma invoice of total of milestone two or three or it will be separate invoice? Let's talk it offline.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, no problem. Yeah, that's more admin. Let's keep them.

Roumanos, Hadi:
They will be separate, but we can take this offline. Yeah, you're right. Wave 2 blueprint is end of Jan. Yes, correct. OK, so in the interest of trying not to always always overrun this meeting. Raul covered his points, Kunal covered his points. I just want to ask Nikita if there's an update on both the training approach and the end users.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
If there is, because I knew you were meeting with Asma.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Has that meeting happened? The meeting didn't happen because Asma was not there. So I wonder if your huddle happened with Asma in the morning.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes, she attended, then she went out, so the hole, then she dropped it. What happened to Asma is because the circle was supposed to be at 2.30, then they changed it to 3, then all of a sudden it became 11.30, so probably she was all over the place. An explanation of why probably she couldn't meet you.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Is there a visibility on when the next window to meet her is?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Maybe tomorrow? I have a suggestion.

Naamani, Mohamad:
We'll send you the tomorrow's 9.30 Nikita. Join us because most probably she also will be there. Let me do that. Either to align on what you need, book her time and that's why we're asking her to join us not only Khaled going forward. Deal? 9.30. Sounds good.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Okay, I sent it now. Let's hope for the best.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let me know if there's anything that we can do or Khaled can do in case, like for instance, she doesn't join. Maybe Khaled can help us find a slot that's open for her during the day where you can meet her. Okay, fine.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
We worked with Tarek and Wadalla today on the awareness session for focal points. And at the same time, we talked through the training roadmap overall, showing them that it's not a good practice to kind of continue postponing and signing the end users because we are approaching the times when we need to finalize the project or sorry, the training plan. And that's becoming closer and closer to the critical path, basically, where we have the key user training connected with the UAT.

 So we just said, in a very polite way, me and Bisher, we said no to them to postpone anything. That's a good thing.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Do you have visibility on when, I remember last week we said the tentative date for the the awareness session would be Tuesday this week, which is today.

Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, now it's the same next week. Yeah, unfortunately, now they're shifting it to the next week. Because we actually disconnected the audience for the awareness session from the experienced audience for the UT. So that's why we thought it's not that risky to have it postponed. But we say it can't be postponed any longer. Because we need names, we need magnitude, we need the volumes of people, right, to kind of just imagine how to split people into courses, groups, by weeks, etc.



Roumanos, Hadi:
My suggestion is to start preparing them from now, so either send an email saying, hey, we have a session on DateX, and again, use the Styrko as sort of a catalyst for that discussion to avoid any further you know, suggestions to postpone if you need to, right? But the sooner this gets scheduled and the sooner people are engaged, the less likely they will have a tendency to postpone. Go ahead, Bishu.



Gusev, Nikita (UAE):
Yeah, I think we need to also kind of pass this message on through Asma, since she was at the steering committee and basically... Yeah, you can, you can, right?

Roumanos, Hadi:
So again, you can... Tomorrow morning, yeah. Agreed, agreed. You can tell her an email to the guys tell you can reference the circle I completely agree if it comes from her even better yeah I'm sorry hadi to your point um the inventory team will be sharing a memo

1Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
to the leadership of all of these focal points to emphasize the importance of the activity and to ensure their attendance when is this going to be sent tomorrow so let us know tomorrow in the huddle whether this happened or

Roumanos, Hadi:
not I know the way things work work, they tend to postpone things.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So just I'll wait for your confirmation. And on that note, yes, Tara and team for the invite for next week and the one after. We even told Khaled, one, we need keep pushing to confirm attendance. And I'm not sure how we can send this in a nice way. We need to tell them they need to have the camera on to ensure they're fully on board with us. So yes, over the next few days, we need to be a bit nasty.

 So to ensure max success of the sessions?

Roumanos, Hadi:
My only direction here is don't take things for granted. Don't assume people will show up. Don't assume that because they said, yes, we would like to have that awareness session on whatever, Tuesday, that it's going to happen. Don't assume anything. Send emails, send directives, say, hey, in this awareness session, we need you all to be present with cameras on. With questions, this is the agenda, right?

 So as much as you can involve people, it will have a higher likelihood to succeed.

1Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, the only point probably I can highlight here is that the workshop or the meetings which we have planned are AGC specific for people to involve in the specific discussion. But what I understand from the discussion with Hector and Bastian, we may have to change that approach. So probably after the huddle, if we can wait for 10 minutes to align on that approach on the users for the specific workshops or meetings, then let's align on it.



Naamani, Mohamad:
So yeah, let's do this ASAP. I think if we're done with the bigger group, Hadi, let's jump to this discussion with a smaller group.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Before I let people go, Before I let everyone go, I need from Rocio a breakdown of what configuration means. I don't know if you've had a conversation with Tara yet, but what that helps us do is understand from your side what are the underlying activities under configuration and who's doing them, so that Raoul can have an easier time tracking progress in these underlying activities, right? So for us right now, we know that GoSCM is working on configuration.

 That's all we know, right? For the next few weeks. So it would help if you can break that down for us and tell us who's working on what so that Rahul can check individually on progress with these people.

Rocio Minguillon:
Does that make sense?

Madhavan, Tara:
Okay, I will talk with Rahul and also Tania. Rocio, I had sent a template. If you can fill that up and share.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Either fill that up and share or sit with Raoul and do it together. Either way is fine, as long as we have some visibility. Don't add unnecessary work. For me, it's a 30-minute discussion with Raoul that gives him the entire view. This is admin stuff.

Rocio Minguillon:
I will forward you a session that I on Thursday also with Tara.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Forward it to Raul in case Tara is still in her training. Okay, now we can have everybody else drop.

Patel, Rahul:
So who do we need, Raul? We need Hector Palacios, Rocio and Sebastian. That's what our team mentioned in the call, along with the PMO team. Yeah, obviously.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I mean, PMO everywhere. So everybody else?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Thank you. Why does PMO team always get the short stick?

Sebastian Alba:
Fine, it's your show. Go ahead, Rahul.

Patel, Rahul:
The point I want to bring to notice is that the workshops which we have planned or the invites which we have sent for the two weeks. The initial understanding was that we have three sessions, which means we can split the sessions between AGCs so that we can have AGC-specific focused discussion. But now, based on today's understanding, GoSM team feels that we will not be able to complete the entire content for the specific topic in two hours for those AGCs and then repeat the content again for the different agencies, which means we may have to think of the sessions as three sessions in three parts and involve all the agencies in their discussions.

 So that's what it looks like, So that's why we're bringing this point to this forum so that we can discuss, understand, and plan it better.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But guys, this means Each of those sessions, I think if I'm not mistaken, the first one is Demand MRO, we had three sessions. Originally it's, let's say, five reps of group companies in the first, five in the second, five in the third. Now we're saying all 15 should be in every single session, which means two things. The invites will be different, whomever got three sessions probably, if I'm a GC, it will be demand MRO, inventory MRO, and then.

 Yeah. So I got two sessions. Now I'll have six. What is the reason? Explain to me more, please. Because the challenge here will be we're keeping everyone in all sessions, or let's take a group. If I'm supposed to attend, let's say Demand MRO one session, now I should attend all three of them, if I understood well. So what's the constraint here, Bastian, or anyone who would like to explain? Because, I mean, we can always update the invites, but it might be, why guys, you're having that many sessions?

 And the question would be, will be able cover in those three sessions whatever you originally thought you couldn't in the original approach? I don't know if it's Sebastian or Sebastian who would like to answer, or Hector or Rocio.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Anyone?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, we discussed it today.

Bastian Osorio:
Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, we, I don't remember having said that we will have only one session per a couple of AGCs. So this is not a change for us. This was the initial idea. But of course, what I'm sure is that we won't be able to cover everything. We need to cover it in just two-hour session. We won't be able to review the entire demand planning process in two hours. Our inventory planning in two sessions.

 There's plenty to be covered. Sorry, go ahead, Basti.

Patel, Rahul:
While I don't want to dwell on the fact that we had discussed this, and we can focus on what we want to plan ahead with, but I would disagree that this was not discussed before.

Bastian Osorio:
No, I'm not saying we didn't discuss, I think, For sure, I agree with you, Rahul. We did discuss this. What I'm saying is that we didn't come up, I mean, in the file we shared, we didn't say, okay, AGC, ABC will be part of the first meeting, and then AGC. Yes, that's something. Agreed.

Patel, Rahul:
That's something based upon the original discussion we had, me and Tara put up this so that since we have three sessions, we understood the stakeholders which are there in each AGC, and then based upon the common interest of You see we've clipped it. Yeah. OK. Sorry guys going forward.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Tara and Raul just to make sure because this is what we've done for workshops for before. Once we finalize and attendees will share this so that we're all on the same page. Now this is behind us. It happened. I think Raul you and Tara and if I'm sharing the right list. For each of the meetings, for example, maintenance, chemicals, I think we're talking here demand and inventory for maintenance. You pick, there's always the common HQ person, and then let's say you pick three here, then three here, three here, for whatever reason.

 Now, regardless of how, my understanding that per the invites that were sent, because we will have three, then in second session, we'll have another three, then another three. To your point, Bastian, each of the session, you'll go through all scenarios. Because it's, I mean, they are different GC, so they have the right to see all the scenarios. However, now that we're saying, let's do a different cut, we will have All reps in first section will cover some scenarios.

 In the second one, all reps, the remaining set, I mean, let's say we have 30 scenarios, 10, 10, just as a number, which will allow us to manage to have those sessions useful. And as I mentioned, we're pushing for them, if they're remote, use their laptops. Attend in person, we'll have a couple of laptops ready for them, but the ideal scenario will be each person is trying his or her scenario on their machine.



Bastian Osorio:
Is that the correct understanding, Bastian, of how you'd like to do this? Yes, yes, the idea was they're doing hands-on session, they're collaborating, they're checking the muscle data, they're checking the integration, so on and so forth. I'm not sure if we're going to be to do this, but that this was the original plan.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah. Now the question about this, let's say we're doing the ideal scenario where you came on site and we have, uh, in this case, maybe 10, just for the sake of argument, 10 people, what you wanted to do is between you and Hector. And definitely we have Raul Koshbu, whomever can help you. People will be working in parallel. One person will be taking one script doing on his or her screen. Another person might be doing the same script or something else or doing the same for different materials because they're different group companies that's your point yeah okay I'm just trying to see okay if we're doing this now I think that's why you said that you know not sure how it will work if we're doing remotely it will have to be.

 Because in person, I think you'll go around the table checking. Okay, Mr.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
X.

Bastian Osorio:
This is why someone has a connection problem.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Someone has a doubt or results just being able to do this right now. Uh, in the interest of time, how many scenarios we do we have or scripts to run or cases to try in a way? Roughly. 50, 10, 200? Sorry, what was the question? How many cases or scenarios do we have to run total, not in each case? No, I don't have a number.

Bastian Osorio:
I need to check the screen.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, I mean, roughly, are we talking about 200 or total of 12? No, of course not. Yeah, so something like, let's say, for the sake of argument also, it's five scenarios. Let's say 30, and it's 10 in each of the sessions. In this case, because we're doing remote work, ideally in two hours, you would like for each of the 10 scenarios, if not, because we're doing online, if not asking every person to share their screen, is to allow them to do some of the work on their own screen while you are sharing that same scenario on the main your user and going with them step by step so I'm thinking out loud how it will work let's say we're talking

Bastian Osorio:
about scenario that I don't know how feasible it is because if I'm sharing how can I guide them if they have to do it on their own it's gonna be complicated because you cannot be looking at two screens at the same time unless you have two screens, which I don't know if it's the case.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So that's why I'm simulating it. So let's say you're sharing your screen. And again, I'm now improvising, you're sharing your screen and telling them, okay, these are the step by step things you need to do on your individual screens, with the same steps, except for different data, because it's different group companies, they will do the same. Now, again, speculating, if they got stuck, we will ask them to share their screen, show us what you have.

 It's almost the simulation of you going to the station and telling them what's happening. We will say, can you please share your screen? Did it work? Yes or no? It's not ideal, I know, but that's the best we can do. Again, we learned, and I think this is for all of us, I'm not going to exclude anyone from this responsibility, because we expected each person to have a machine in person, and we know the facility that they have.

 I think we were very optimistic thinking that all of them will come with their laptop and they will be working on that. It's not the reality. How can we manage SIT, UAT will come next, but for now, we need to be creative. So one scenario, Bastian, as you said, or as I was proposing, you're sharing your screen telling them, dear team, I would like you on your machine. First login, pick an item, it will be different depending on do this, do that, etc.

 And tell us what are the results. Now, ideally, even if you're in person, you would have waited for everyone to execute the script, get the expectation or an understanding before you move to another script, right?

Hector Palacios:
That is a huge complication in projects. I don't know how we are going to do it right here, but trying to follow up the script with the user on the session is kind of impossible, to be honest. Especially if you're thinking like you're going to have like 12 people there trying to do the same thing in parallel.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's why I'm saying let's take as a baseline what we were planning to do in the room. We have 10 or 20 people. You were going to check around and making sure before you move to the next script. The first one, everyone is happy and know how to do this, right? Let's ignore online or all the constraints.

Bastian Osorio:
In reality, this is the black. Sorry to interrupt. It's just, for example, I'm going to run a model. I show how to run a model. Then you guys run the model. Let's give 10, 15 minutes so they can run the model. And let's let's see if there's any doubt. And we, in the meantime, can be in the room helping. Here, we will check here, check that. I cannot go into the room and I cannot, we cannot do that sharing the screen because if there is 15 people who are going to share the screen, I don't know, it sounds complex.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Now, I'm not going to make it to say it's very simple, but I don't think it's impossible. I'll tell you what I'm thinking. Again, it's not ideal. But this is what we can do to manage the situation. You're planning to go and check their individual screen to see how they got stuck or if they got the real results. Now, we will ask them to share their screen. Instead of you going to their desk, we're asking someone who's doing the work to share their screen on Teams to show you and the rest of the team what they've done.

 And then a second third. For me, it's It's almost doing it instead of you going, because in both cases, whether in person or remote, people will face issues. Let's agree to this. They could be getting stuck on the first step or the second or whatever in the screen.

Bastian Osorio:
Sorry, but we're not going to do like, I'm not going to ask someone to share the screen and do the process without first someone having done it. Or I doing it first because it will take forever. They know how to use the system, so it will take forever.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, which you do anyway. So the starting point is. You're showing your screen telling them this is what we need to do and you'll do this whether the remote or in the room you're giving this sort of orientation or ABC just instructions. Then you'll tell them I would like you to apply this on your. Machine if they are next to you, you in the room, you'll go around the table, check, okay, did you try the example or the exercise, you forgot the step, etc.

 What I'm saying as an alternative, instead of going around the table, you're doing virtually going around the table by asking each person, if they're okay, fine, then maybe no need to share the screen. If they're stuck, they will share the screen, which is the equivalent of you going to their chair and checking. That's what I'm saying. Is it ideal? No, but it's as close as possible to managing this so that we can benefit and engage with them.



Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, also we can progress, I don't know, in five steps and they can put in the chat if they're getting problems in one of the steps. And so we decided that the best moment to resolve that because if everyone is interacting, like say, no, I'm not fine that well, but it's it's a matter of finding the way. Yeah, it's not going to be.

Hector Palacios:
It's not going to be. Sorry, sorry, sorry. This is not going to happen. We are not going to make them work on the session and to pretend that we are going to finish on time. That's not going to happen.

Bastian Osorio:
I agree with you, Hector.

Naamani, Mohamad:
OK, so this is this is all we're all mature. I would like solutions. We are where we are. We can either saying we need, as a miracle, machines to be ready and they come on site or we try to manage. No, no, but I'm saying guys, that's why I'm saying I understand that you think it's difficult. I'm not arguing with this. I'm saying short of doing another extension of the timeline until they have the room and the facility and everything ready for us to do around the table.

 Again, it's our collective mistake that we thought this will happen and they will all come, not to mention the challenge with the Excel app.

Hector Palacios:
Can I interrupt? Yeah, sure. Let's discuss what we can do. Sorry. Even in the ideal condition, this is not going to happen. If they have the laptop, they have the 12 there, we are going to move as fast as the slowest one. So we are not going to get in time. We have like 30 scenarios probably, I don't know, or since we need to check them.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Hector, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying even if we have all of them in the same room etc, you are not going to execute every script for every person?

Hector Palacios:
For sure, for sure it's not going to happen.

Naamani, Mohamad:
That's my experience.

Hector Palacios:
How are you planning to do this? The only thing that we can finish unit testing is me and Bastian showing the screen. That's the only thing that we can do. And for the unit, for the UAT, we need to think this very well because this is going to be a huge issue. If you think that this design station for closing the documents that took time, imagine UAT with 12 people trying to get this done at the same time and I don't know if percentially or if they are going to be

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
remote.

Hector Palacios:
But the problem here is the amount of people that we need to work with.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, very valid. We need to plan it properly from now, not in a week, not in a couple of weeks, as early as, I mean, we can plan separately. So Tara, Hadi and I, while you work on. But based on this, I think there's a bit of a disconnect. Bastian, at least I understood that the purpose of you being physically there not only to explain, like you mentioned now, Hector, going through every script and telling them, this is the script, this is how you execute it.

 If you're in group company X, it will be a different list of data item or material company Y. Are you clear on this script, questions, et cetera, move to the second, finish, let's say, 10 per session, and in three sessions, you'll finish all of them. My understanding from Bastian that you were planning to give them the chance to play with the system. While Hector, you're saying, no, we will not have time.

 So unit test is you running the show and or using this opportunity to give them that feel and comment or ask question about the script.

Bastian Osorio:
So which story is better?

Hector Palacios:
I think, I think, I think I didn't explain myself. The ideal scenario is to give them anticipated feeling of the system. From the beginning to see, interact with the system. That is what I like to do in my breaks. The big challenge here is the amount of people.

Bastian Osorio:
Hector, just to complement what you're saying. That's right, I think, but not for all the cases in the script. It's just an initial approach to the system. Log in, let's look at some planning views. Let's maybe run one job. It's just an initial approach to the system. Because they just have seen PPTs, a couple of examples, and that's it. So the ideal case was, of course, it's not feasible, and I agree with everyone here, it's not feasible to go through 30 use cases in six hours.

 It's not feasible, not at all, absolutely sure. What is feasible is that they have Excel ID, and they can access to a system, and they can look at a couple of prepared planning views. And the rest of the session, us showing all the process, the entire process, and answering questions. So when I was saying us showing something and answering questions, yes, but not for every single case, just for one simple, basic cases.

 Again, hands-on session, but in the most basic way, in the most basic stuff. Again, it's a first approach to the system.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, only for that one we would spend like two hour sessions, only for the basics. We need to have either two for going with the scenarios.

Naamani, Mohamad:
First session will be for them to get familiar how to log in, how to navigate, and then the other two for you to show them how to apply the scripts, Now that they have an idea how the solution works overall, how to navigate or move from one thing to the other. So that's the mix that you're referring to. Yeah, I mean, maybe my confusion is because when you move from this session of acquaintance to the actually you running the show, you being in the same room other than them asking you a question and you're physically there instead of online, there is no benefit in when you start running the scripts, because basically whether you're doing it in person, half of them are there, half of them on Teams, which we cannot prevent like in design workshops, or they're all in the same room, it's almost similar quality.

 While for the first one, which is orientation, acquaintance to get to know the system, I agree. If they're all in one room, you can just, okay, click here to log in, blah, blah, which will be faster. Is that correct? So basically we're doing quick orientation and then you're running the show Hector and Bastien, with them asking questions.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah and still even I think the idea was not to cover and that's why we discussed a lot about the MVP. Even in six hours and with hands-on at least in the first few hours to a hands-off session we're not gonna be able to cover the entire script with all the questions that we want to address. The idea was, again, give a first flavor of what is the system of the core functionalities. And they're giving some feedback.

 But of course, going through the entire script is not feasible. And for me, this is going to happen, will happen during the UATs.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Look, I think The important discovery or conclusion out of this, now UT, as you both mentioned, it has a purpose, getting more familiar, seeing is believing, and then you can show them how those scripts will be executed. But what you're referring to means we need to very, very properly and meticulously and in details plan for the UAT, including how many sessions, How much time do we plan or we think it will take each attendee to finish this part?

 And in that case, so almost a simulation of those sessions. Because right now, Hector said, okay, we'll run the show, but it's going to be impossible for everyone to do his or her part. Valid. When you go to UAT, if I'm one of the expected, again, UAT is key users, not the end user. End user is training only. Those key users, let's say it's one per group company. If I don't get the chance to try my scenario, I'm not going to give you an approval, which means we need to check how many scenarios, how many people are going to execute, what is the expected timeline, including some questions or hiccups, and based on it, confirm the number of sessions, the attendance, in addition to the logistics or the rooms.

 Especially since you cannot prevent, and you're the experts, you can confirm, after you list a few scripts, someone will say, how about this? I would like to know how you do this. And to mitigate this part, I would say during next week and the other, and the one after, we need to, just like we got signed off on the BPD, BRD, but mainly BPD, is to get signed off from them on the test cases that they will see in UAT.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
If you agree with me.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes, I would like to make sure that there will be no surprises because UAT will have surprises. Someone getting stuck on something in the system or disagreeing or raising a point. No, I thought it's last thing we want. On top of that is someone coming up with completely new script or scripts because that will be a complete.

Bastian Osorio:
I lost you for a second. I lost you for a second.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, I'm saying the reason next week and the one after we need to make sure we agree with them on those scripts. It's like, uh, this is, this will be the agenda for the UAT we're going to do. Case one is this case two, case three, case four. In UAT when you approve, you might have question on those cases, but don't come with 20% extra because you got to mention them, it will be a disaster. We cannot prevent an exception, but if we do not ring fence what are those scripts, we will get into UAT and it will take two months.

 Because I thought, you thought, you told me this, but I didn't see it. We discussed it in design, you told us you'll see it later in the system. So at least for me, the takeaway now of this discussion, SIT UAT needs to be very meticulously planned so that we get their approval. Otherwise, what you mentioned about design documents review will be a joke or an easy case versus UAT.

Bastian Osorio:
Sorry to cut you off, Rahul wanted to say something.

1Patel, Rahul:
So the point I'm making is that from an immediate planning perspective, we need to invite everyone those three sessions. Yes, I wanted to go back to this. Now it's a different case. Yeah, and the one recommendation I have is now that the sessions are virtual in nature, we can utilize Monday for this initial session with everyone where we spend time with them, probably two sessions, just to set up the system, get this initial view so that Tuesday onward sessions can be more focused on process and we don't lose time considering that this is going to be the online session we can utilize this Monday to have this initial two sessions with users to just set up and give them feel so that whatever initial agenda that you were trying to have with users in person where we get this probably we can utilize Monday for this so that this gives us some more time to focus on the processes in the actual sessions.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What do you think? Yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
This can use orientation session. Bastion is the same regardless of your talking demand or inventory and a model or comic is right that that intro on how to navigate is Common or it's also specific for demand versus inventory I Will say it's just for

Bastian Osorio:
demanding inventory because we don't have any supply data.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So I know but it's a common session So if you're briefing me as a as a key user on how to navigate how to do this, how to get comfortable with the system. You're not doing it differently for demand versus inventory. You'll blend both topics together. You'll say this is how we navigate the different modules of IBP. And also, if we're talking MRO or chemicals, same thing. It's more of accessing the system, not different modules or different functions.

 Correct or no?

Bastian Osorio:
Not really. Drilling, for example, if someone, okay, I'm going to log in the system, that is, of course, common. But then if I want to open, can I look at some drilling information? No, because there's no drilling information.

Rocio Minguillon:
But drilling is not in this unit testing, no?

Bastian Osorio:
No, that's why I'm saying it's not.

Naamani, Mohamad:
It's not coming for all the different scenarios If you're showing them how their uh, the chemicals or mro data will look like or how to access it Until their data is ready the drilling data. It's fine. They'll understand the same concept Yes, but but this is something that they they have mentioned many times.

Bastian Osorio:
I mean i've said not I want to see real data we're gonna give the same answer. No, it's not possible.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed.

1Patel, Rahul:
So drilling is an exception. Let's have it considering that the changes we have discussed between yesterday and today and alignment will need to have. So probably let's put up an agenda for Monday, probably focusing more on MRO and chemicals. At least we are covering 70-80% because we have only two users for drilling, which is Abdul Latif and Mohammed Ashiq, which means we can have a separate session with them.

 And can be a quick session, but at least the rest of the audience can be part of this Monday's discussion, which can be more generic in nature, which focuses on MRO and chemicals, system signing up, logging and looking at data and different things.

Bastian Osorio:
Sorry, Rahul, but will they have the XLADIN? We are pushing for it.

1Patel, Rahul:
So the assumption is they should have everything, but yeah, let's push for XLADIN. And in terms of see if we can leverage this Monday to have it a common session, which will be able to set up. Yeah. Accelerating is an important input to it, but right now we don't have that information, right? So let's plan for it. Let's see if we are able to do it. If we don't have accelerating anyways, even if we have to, even if you're traveling and even if you're trying to do it Tuesday, it won't work.

 We'll end up showing what our screens are, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Naamani, Mohamad:
So what is the summary? Are we adding a session or two on Monday for an orientation and then. Tuesday onwards go into the scripts.

Bastian Osorio:
We can do have only if they have the excellent otherwise the orientation won't be useful because they won't have anything where. They need to test it.

Naamani, Mohamad:
If they don't test it, they will forget it. Yeah, I mean. I think giving them that orientation. And you need to do this anyway. Them applying it on their machine immediately or not, we're pushing for this. I mean, I think Khaled already hates me more, not hates me, he already hates me. And everyone is pushing to do this, including what we said, what saying, SVP said we need to act, please, this is a hotline.

 Now, can I guarantee that we have it ready? No. We'll work against this, that we will have the orientation set session, assuming they have add-on installed on their machine after it's approved as a new application. Now, but in summary, we're agreeing that we need to have invites for Monday or we will use Tuesday for that orientation, because also guys keep in mind now we're changing from someone attending one session, for example, demand MRO, he or she will attend We're also telling them, on top of that, you'll attend an orientation session.

 That's for the demand team. Same for inventory MRO. It will be common. Orientation is common. But they will have three sessions. I'm only concerned that they'll say, yes, but I have something else. We'll need to validate this logistic feasibility or availability, Raoul, Raul and Tara with Khalid in the morning and Asma. We'll have them both. We'll say we have the following.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry.

Patel, Rahul:
With both Asma and Khalid to make sure that they understand them and then confirm the reliability.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yes. OK, so one or two orientation session. If it's an orientation and it's a couple of hours, it should be only one.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, but then. And again, we need to confirm first they have the Excel add-in. Otherwise, there's no point to invite everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Naamani, Mohamad:
If let's say they don't have the Excel add-in, why cancel the orientation? They will see it on their basically your machine. They might not be able to apply it. I understand they will forget it. But it's anyway, you need to do this before you move the next day or the next session to do the scripts. And every time in the script you show something, you can keep repeating that thing. OK, this is how we log in, blah, blah.

 Unless you're saying let's not do it if they don't have the add-in, it's a waste of time, we'll move, jump, we'll jump immediately to scripts. Your decision. Yeah. You and Hector explained. So are we saying let's keep it even if they don't have the Excel add-in or we'll cancel it? We need to book from now guys. We cannot. Yeah, yeah.

Bastian Osorio:
That is what I'm saying. If we don't have the Excel add-in, Would I wouldn't do that introduction session because they will forget it and we will still redo it again. So what?

Naamani, Mohamad:
But we need to book it from now assuming that they have the Excel edit if for whatever reason Monday by Monday They didn't have the Excel and then we can cancel it. But for now, we'll have to book it agree Mm-hmm. There's no other option and then Tuesday sessions Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and the week after will continue to be as is but now we need to add all in these, not only a couple of group companies per session, correct?



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Naamani, Mohamad:
OK, something completely not related to this. Guys, this overview session that Mo was preparing to give as like a refresh of the purpose of the solution. Did we book this or when is it going to happen?

Patel, Rahul:
So I have an update on it. This is going to be booked by AdNoc team, because we don't know these people yet. So if we send an invite, probably they might not respond. Because if we send invites, they might not know us and may not accept our invitation.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Sorry, this session is not for the same team who's attending next week? No, no, no, it's not for the same team.

Patel, Rahul:
Then it's for whom? It's for the MRO change end users which are getting part of Okay, if it's not a prerequisite, then fine.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Maybe I misunderstood that. Before they start attending the UT sessions, they wanted a refresh. It's fine. Then all we need to do for when we do the Monday orientation session on IBP is just to keep those one or two slides overview that we have in design to break the ice at the beginning and tell them, now that we move to build, we told you in design sessions that this is what the system does. Now this is how you log in blah blah and over the next few days we'll work on the different scripts with you.

 Okay, so that's the plan, right team? One new session for orientation for Monday with everyone. In that case, everyone means everyone. So almost everyone in demand MRO and inventory MRO and chemical MRO and also in drilling tomorrow. Sorry, drilling, the demand drilling. Would it be possible to make it just for MRO? A week after just for chemicals.

Bastian Osorio:
OK, fine. Just MRO.

Naamani, Mohamad:
But wait a second, one second, let me check next week's schedule. Next week you have one, two, three MRO demand, then four, five, six MRO inventory. So yes, you can do intro for MRO because the six sessions are demand and inventory MRO. The week after you have, the week after we're starting Monday, we have chemicals three sessions demand, then chemicals three session inventory. And then only two drilling on Thursday drilling demand.

 There's no drilling. Yeah, I think I think we can cancel.

Bastian Osorio:
I think we can cancel those drilling because. Yeah, no need for start.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I think to manage them now we might have them and tell them look because of 123 because if you cancel it and say OK, not everyone will understand the data challenge if we have If instead of having two sessions, we'll have one, explain to them what we did for other verticals, MRO and chemicals, telling them, look, we have some data challenges we're working on. I would like Vignesh and Khalid to explain.

 It would be better to manage their expectation and their mood so that we don't lose them and they'll get frustrated. That's my thinking. Anyway, from now, let's book them. Everyone is happy if you cancel a meeting. Later on, but no one is happy if out of nowhere you schedule one. So that's my thinking. Let's book all of them and then if there's something changed, we can cancel. Okay? Okay. Okay. So Monday will be Amaro orientation.

 Uh, I think, uh, Tara and, uh, uh, Raul, you can agree on who needs to attend, which is basically all inventory and demand Amaro. And the next week session, And the one after they will have to be changed to include all GCs.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So merge all the attendees.

Patel, Rahul:
This merger will happen after we discuss in the morning tomorrow, right?

Naamani, Mohamad:
But the problem Tara has a training tomorrow, so I don't want us to send this. So I mean if that merger can happen now or tomorrow morning, fine. But if Tara is not available until later in the day, I don't want to lose the whole day because of this to update. So I want everyone to see the three invites in his or her inbox instead of one. If I'm a MRO demand or MRO inventory. Okay. I agree.

Patel, Rahul:
Let's do this. Then Tara probably maybe we can stay back for a minute or two.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Align on. She can tell you what time is her training. If she's starting at 10 and she can do this in the morning. I don't want to kill anyone or my train. Okay. Look, you decide. It takes 15 minutes to do this or to align. You can do this now, you can do this in the morning. I don't want to micromanage, but let's make sure we don't lose the day tomorrow.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed. Okay. Yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And if you want to write a small notice saying, team, this is an update of the previous invite so that we can have all group companies represented in this meeting, blah, blah, something like this so that people will understand why they're getting new invites.

Patel, Rahul:
And we can communicate to Khalid and Asma that now that we are not getting users in the meeting room, we are planning this way so that we are able to manage with them online with more time.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Sure. What you can do, you can update those in the morning with Tara before the huddle. But don't click Send in the huddle. Brief them, and then click Send before Tara goes to her training. OK. Make sense? OK. Make sense. Bye, everyone. Yeah, we'll get this. At least today's tear co means we have more muscle to push. Let's see how we can use this better. Maybe U. T. Is a bit of a short notice, but for the rest we have to.



Patel, Rahul:
All right. Okay, thanks, everyone.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.
