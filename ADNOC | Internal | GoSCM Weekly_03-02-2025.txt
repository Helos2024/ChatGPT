Rocio Minguillon:
I have it configured in the compu without problems. Yes, now I'm going to tell you a little about that. You have it without problems, but at any time it's going to break. I right now I think I'm using the old account. Yes, you have the old account, but it seems to me as external. Yes, yes, yes, yes. But hey, don't worry, I assume that you are already using it. This driver is bringing me a lot of problems.

 Hello guys!

Rocio Minguillon:
Thank you for joining. That's why you got about a minute. Rest of the team. Hello team, how are you?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Fee.

Arun Singh:
Rocio, you have shared a few file site regarding the roles and authorization, I think, over the team. So which one is the good one that we can start populating some values that we are maintaining in the AdNoc system?

Rocio Minguillon:
Sure, yes. Give me one second, then I will post it directly our SharePoint, so we're going to ask it from there. Let me find it because I need this new thing to work. That is the second one. I will put it in there. One second. Always the same. Here goes the CM, see all the channels, methodology. Geos, comprehensive methodology. Deploy, cutover, rows and profiles. I have other examples. This one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What is the word for parafiles in English? Profiles? That's the word in AVP or?

Rocio Minguillon:
Profiles, yeah. But in AVP that's the name? Okay. I think it's roles on users. Business role to be precise. Business roles but the permission filter is there.

Rocio Minguillon:
owns an authorization, maybe you can. Okay, so who is missing? Saulian, Bastia, Nectar? Or Vivek. Okay, maybe I will just start. Okay, so and then I put it there, Arun. So this is a good file. Use it as you want. I mean, as is useful for you. But here, like the structure of the roles where you identify the – well, all the columns are here, but it's pretty useful because then you have the leading roles catalogs to put all the catalogs that are there and so

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
on. Okay. Hi, Saul.

Rocio Minguillon:
Hi, Rocio. Hi. So, okay. I will try, oh, we need Hector and Basti and Vivek, so I don't have to repeat.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Vivek.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, okay. It was just too...

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay just to be clear with you I see that most of you except from Saul I think, Pelayo, Rey, Arunfi you are all logged by the desktop and I mean you're getting inside from here. Okay the thing is that this is kind of working like for now I mean some of you may have this alert here but it's not causing any issue. But the thing is that you are not receiving updates on the meetings or new meetings or whatever.

 So be careful with that. I recommend you, I mean, the good thing about the desktop is that you can see all the chats that you had before and you can see everything as it was. But be careful because you are not accessing to all the new things that you are shared or whatever. For example, Tara sent me a meeting and I don't have it in that Teams, I have it here. But the problem is, so I recommend you and I ask you, if you can please try to access from the web.

 So you can see. But the problem on the web is that you don't see the teams groups. So you don't see the chats that we were having. Here we were laughing with Fiamma because we have like two teams that it's like a metaverse where we have lots of words. But well, that's the thing. I think that probably this will be fixed soon. But for now, I please ask you to have both a this and the teams and try to join the meetings with one of them.

 So, can you try to access? Okay. Then to access to the files, the thing is that you have to look for your team's years, because if you try to access to files like for the names, that you were having before, like for example, I don't know, I would say this is status, for example. This may not work because it's calling, yeah, this doesn't work because it's calling like the previous URL, so it's not working.

 So the way I found it to work, it's like going to the teams, web teams, then open the different files or the different folders from there and then you will have access to all. Yeah. Are you following me? Are you following me? Or so and so? Yes. Yeah, yes. But in my case, I received a meeting today but in the desktop, not in the web. That's weird. It's like maybe from someone from the organization that was scheduling the meeting from here yeah it was from bastian and it I received it in my in my app not yeah that was probably because he was scheduling the meeting from here but in the case of app not for example if they put uh they are they are using the new tenant yeah so they work but it's not the recommendation.

 I mean. You can use it and did it. It doesn't work anymore, but be careful and have this open because from the customer or you will receive the different things from here. So to avoid problems, let's have two of the of the things. Like open. And yeah, and then will, uh, Hello, Vivek, you were able to join. Finally. Yeah, I mean, I've been like 40 minutes with a guy from a support, I don't know from which company helping me.

 So I understood some things, but it's not working pretty well. But what I was telling Vivek is that please have the both of the Teams open, the one from the web and the one from the Teams because you may receive the updates on the web one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
From the customer mostly because if you send a meeting from here, you will receive it. But if the customer send a meeting to your email, you will receive it in the new tenant or So you will not see it in your application if it's not being graded. And the way of migrating this application, I'm not sure. I mean, there's still no solution. This is still not working. The guy told me to wait. But for now, yeah, we should access by web.

 And then what else? So to access to the file, use these themes, and here you will find all the themes where you were part of, and then you can always open the files and open the thing. Okay. So, everyone is clear? Anyone need something or any help? So, no, it's okay? Saul, you're okay? Ray, Pablo?

Saul Portillo:
Yes, I think for now it's okay. I need to review, but I can join to this meeting and the meetings in the morning. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
The only thing is that, yeah, that I want you to be able to join the meetings and to access to the different documents that you need. You should not have problems with that. If you have problems, please You can contact me and then we can see. Regarding the tasks, where is my planner? I have it open. This is not going to work, I think. No, one second.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
here.

Rocio Minguillon:
So I was about to ask, Greg, regarding the FSD, if you were able to see the comments that they made, I think, on Thursday at the end of the day. I don't know if you were able to see them or to see whether – they also talk about some extra requirements that were missing, but I I don't know if you were able to see it.

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
Yeah, I saw the comment from Google, I think. It was the email. But I wasn't able to populate on the document, OK? Because on Friday, I went off holiday. I don't know. It's not holiday. So I went off yeah, so I will take that over today, okay, okay?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, I will ask him to send the documents through email if we don't have it because we don't have access to KPMG folder Okay, okay I'll ask him right now.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Okay, I will just read this email after. Okay, so...

Rocio Minguillon:
Sorry, Ray. Sorry, Rocio.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
When was your birthday, Reinaldo?

Rocio Minguillon:
um january 6th ah okay you were on holiday Saul or or well I don't remember but yeah no I don't remember I was working that day yeah yeah but Saul I don't know because we we said we said happy birthday to you this time yep yeah I remember okay okay hi So I was clarifying the team how to work with this thing about an office, then maybe after the huddle we can connect a couple of minutes and I can help you if you're having troubles with the two accounts on the tenant and whatever.



Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, yeah, I just I think I want to go to the urgent thing. Is Arun here? Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How are you Arun?

Bastian Osorio:
So I understand that you had a meeting with Rahul and the users and they already provide some, let's say, most part of the data. For Thursday session so what I would do I was just speaking with Rahul in the idea is to to first see if we can at least show something internally tomorrow with him and then basically we're gonna decide if we make one two session or if we postpone the sessions okay so before saying Joem, do you feel like we have enough information, enough content to prepare something?

 And then on the top of that, do we feel, do you feel that we have enough time to prepare something that is at the level of the user expectations?

Arun Singh:
So they'll be sending data by tomorrow and we don't have any data.

Bastian Osorio:
They provide some data, but still there is some.

Arun Singh:
No, they did not provide any data so far. Okay we have provided them with the sample data okay so today we had a call with the onshore business and we have shown the idea behind the templates and the sample data so they are still working on the data

Bastian Osorio:
part and by tomorrow they'll be you know hopefully we will get some data okay still in terms of requirements are you clear in the sense of what they want to see?

Arun Singh:
Yeah. So basically, we'll be integrating or uploading all the well-planned plus the material forecast. And that's what they want to see in IBP, first of all.

Bastian Osorio:
The thing that I feel for drilling, let's say they provided data. I mean, besides showing the data, but in IBP, what else where we cannot be able to show? That's my my concern.

Arun Singh:
So that concern I have too, because even I have this question. Basically, they are doing a material forecasting in UWDP. OK, so what IBP can add a value? OK, because initially we were about you know the bomb explosion all those uh fun feasibility options in into IBP but now we will be just integrating uh the forecast so I don't know like uh do they need to have some like uh what if simulation scenario but that will not uh that could be one of these scenario but uh we probably need to integrate uh let's say some budget value or something okay then uh the budget the forecasting value is aligned with the budget or not that could be one of the case into IPP for the approval process to finalize the forecast okay apart from that I don't think there is any any usage for IPP okay yeah

Bastian Osorio:
because the core of the solution is in supply it's not in demand exactly What I think we can do is to connect today, later, after the huddle, stay a few minutes, and just talk with Rahul and the rest of the team and see what are we planning to show on Thursday. Because if there's nothing substantial, and if we are just getting the data, then what's the point of time decision?

Arun Singh:
Exactly. And also, same thing goes with tie-in, OK? Because so far, we have not been discussing about tie-in. So tie-in goes in line with drilling, as far as about the design is concerned. Yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
The tie-in session, I think it's not scheduled. So it's not that problem. But then, Bastian, I know when you talk about this, please ensure that I'm also there. I'm very, very sure that we already said that a lot of times, but the strategy was, okay, let's keep the session just in case, and then we can cancel it if it's not feasible to run it. So I can't be the one that make that clear. So we don't have any.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
I have to work with Tara because she's asking me on some, things before the huddle. So I have to go with her. We already talked about the FSD that Ray is gonna review today. So please, if you can align the rest of the points together, because I really need to go with Tara.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, no, I think there is nothing. I don't know if someone has something more urgent, but I think that's it pretty much. I'm gonna meet also with Wade and Raul, sorry, with Saul and Fiamma later to keep working on the data. And yeah, that's it. Let's put a long session, a working session between all of us, Basti. Everyone can be working on their own things, but let's have a session together to align for tomorrow as well.

 Yeah. Okay. I'm going to join you there. But after the huddle, I want to meet with, we can stay there with Rahul.

Bastian Osorio:
OK, I think that we lost Rocio, but I don't know what else. Oh, that's it. Let's focus on the session tomorrow, and then later, let's see how we can make this more optimal. I think that we need to take a step back and see how we distribute the load, because we are facing that issue right Yep.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Bastian Osorio:
Let's leave it here for now, guys. OK, Dean. Thank you. Bye-bye.

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
Thank you, Dean. Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye-bye.
