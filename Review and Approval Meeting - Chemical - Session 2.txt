Indeed, because they think they will need it, and they start creating the reservations for that. So that step will be removed.\n\n So instead of that, we will generate an optimized safety stock, and only when the works need the creation of of a work order, they will have to proceed, but not for forecast duration or safety stock reservation.

And the other is based upon the historical consumption you set the reorder points and then based upon the reorder points the replenishment. Now it was discussed during the sessions of chemicals as it's a 2P session, that we will consolidate to have a common process for planning of chemicals, where the demand input would be received in terms of IDP by end users, where they will indicate what is the consumption requirement for next one to three years.\n\n Will support them with the, based upon historical consumption, what is the forecast for next three to five years.

So what I'm saying is MRP type what you're having today in S4 HANA. These are the S4 HANA MRP type. If we are using IBP for planning, IBP needs demand. Based upon demand, IBP will create inventory parameters.\n\n And those inventory parameters will be used in supply planning to use reorder point planning or advanced supply planning. So the MRP type in S4 HANA are not same as what you do supply planning in IBP. Is a completely different process. That's what we were telling from the workshop as well that while we will. That is captured right that we will have in the document we are talking about demand only.\n\n So here we are telling that how demand will get captured as part of supply planning. We will talk about it, how the supply planning will happen, whether it will happen beyond the point planning, whether it will happen at one supply planning and then the advanced algorithms of constraints of supply planning would be used.

Now we need confirmation from you that can we proceed with this. As we proceed, we configure the system. In the next step, we will have the testing with the data from AdNoc and we will demonstrate with AdNoc data how the system is working. It's still in the test environment with test data, which means it's not looking at all which we have an ad hoc.\n\n But then this in the testing phase will be able to demonstrate the functionality of the system. With limited set of data, we can compare what's there in in S4 HANA and what's IBP is proposing for the limited set of data will not be able to do it for all data. Once you get confirmed, once you get this confidence on limited set of data in testing on IBP, we will have to decide a strategy on how the changes will impact on production.\n\n That would be something part of the cutoff strategy because we are having six months of period to fine tune the system after we implement into production, which means that we'll have to define a strategy together. That after we go live, probably the first step would be for you to review everything in production, comparing with what's there in S4 HANA and what's IBP is proposing. So we may have a plan where after go live, we review everything with production data and then take the decision on making that change in applicable in S4 HANA in terms of PR and PO.\n\n So that's something we'll follow as part of the project. So to summarize, today we are doing design. Today we do not have your data, but we have to agree on the design based upon the discussions what we have had. Once the design is agreed upon, we will go into build phase. We will configure IDP based upon your requirement. When we configure with your data, we will demonstrate how IBP is able to perform to what we said in the design document.\n\n If there are any changes, we can make those few changes during the build so that it is in line with what your requirement is. And once you see confidence, we will move to the production and then do the next planning production. That's how. So it's not that you will not be able to review anything and you will be able to analyze everything only in the production. You will have ability to look at the tool, see the outcome, evaluate the outcome with S4 HANA with limited set of data and testing, and then based upon that we will have a plan to migrate the solution in production.\n\n"},{"start_time":1733909757987,"end_time":1733909772208,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"But what do you mean by limited set of data Rahul?

Now, just to have common understanding between the team, I mean, Adnok team and the KPMG team. First, based on the comment from Arun As I understand from the beginning that in chemical planning we have two scenarios. We have chemical which is currently the forecast and demand consumption everything is being done manually. We have another scenario for chemical which have reorder point and minimum and maximum already set in the ERP system.\n\n Now for the chemical which have minimum and maximum, it was said that it will be, the plan for it, it will be same like MRO, because this is part of MRO also. For chemical which is, which is the bulk is handled manually, that need to be automated in the system. First we have to that this understanding is right or not. Second point which is very important and I think everybody was talking about it and we said this from the day one that what added value this new system will add for the inventory.\n\n All the point which mentioned by Arunkumar and also the point Jaganath has mentioned are very crucial. Now we are using current system, what added value? In saving time, in optimizing stock, we don't want to use new system and then that result in inflating our stock. So how this system will help in saving time, how the system will help in optimizing the stock, in being more vigilant and this point have to be very clear for everybody.\n\n What advantage and that the point which was raised from the beginning that okay now we are using certain system what added value will add to us the system you give us comparison.

Everything will take months to check everything.\n\n So we'll agree with you what could be subject or areas of focus.

It highlights that so that user knows that there is something unusual happening.\n\n And that confirmation user has to still do with the end user so that whatever current process you are following will continue, but system will highlight such unusual consumption changes so that you know that something is going different than normal.

You will have the material code available against that material code in which months you want to trial you need to put as this 10 quantity 10 litre each for three months suppose so you put 10 litre against that metal in those months three months and that will become the requirement on forecast or demand for that material which will go into supply planning and procurement proposal will be created against it.\n\n"},{"start_time":1733913507495,"end_time":1733913507852,"speaker":{"name":"Aysha Abdulla Al Ali (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1733913507852,"end_time":1733913514939,"speaker":{"name":"Arunkumar Viswanathan (ADNOC Refining - HQ)"},"words":"So it seems like one item also or it has to be a group of items Yeah."},{"start_time":1733913515327,"end_time":1733913553004,"speaker":{"name":"MM- SKEC2 - L08"},"words":"Allows you to maintain demand for a group of items, which is called aggregated level planning.

If there is a requirement which is beyond, which is coming in the planning calendar, there are two options.\n\n Either you enter that requirement and it gets considered in the next planning cycle, which means if in the third week, say if you get a demand input and you add that into system, but it will not be considered planning, because supply planning is already considered based on the initial week's input. And it can be part of the next week input, next month's planning cycle, so that it can be considered.\n\n That's one option. If it is very urgent, you can directly use S-400 to create a PR manually.

Now, during that testing, now you will discover some gaps where some requirements you missed to tell us we are human or some development went wrong, they will fix it, bug in the system, it will be fixed.\n\n But again, we will not move live until we get your acceptance on the user acceptance testing that yes the process is working as per my requirement. So this is the stage guys it is called design stage where we see and you are not seeing system it's a piece of word document where you are providing your maximum but try to use your let's say experience to the maximum possible to give us your requirements again if there is something missing here it will be taken later The only thing that will not be taken later easily if you are coming with a new process.\n\n If you are bringing a fix there, some, let's say, considerations there, limitations, a process step, we have no problem. But if you come with a totally new process, which is not mentioned here, that will be a sort of change in our project. Again, I'm not telling you that we'll take it. We'll take it also, but unfortunately, that will have impact on the timeline. Okay? That is part of our project management and it's already, Yaser, it is considered.\n\n So do not worry, my friends here, that you say something and then tomorrow I develop it, put it live, and you are stuck now. It will not go live. Let me repeat myself again. It will not go live until you do a complete and proper user acceptance for all scenarios. Thank you, Yaser. Mentioning this, so at least others, they might have the same doubts."},{"start_time":1733915085992,"end_time":1733915086994,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Thank you, Akhfiras."},{"start_time":1733915086994,"end_time":1733915110337,"speaker":{"name":"Firas Oqdeh (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"I'll leave it to you.
