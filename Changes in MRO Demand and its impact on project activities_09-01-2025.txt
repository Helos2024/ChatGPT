Patel, Rahul:
said now we need to speak to Khaled first but I'm saying I just need to ask my confirm right she's available which means we just need to check why if Khaled can be available then we don't need to make

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
any changes but if Khaled says that he cannot make it and then at what time Khaled is recommending he said on Monday between uh Monday at one to two but then I need to check if Asma and the rest of the team are available on Monday and I'm also not sure Putting too much time and energy to make sure people are available.

Patel, Rahul:
So maybe you can just speak to him and let me know.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
So let's talk to him today later.

Patel, Rahul:
If he's not available, let's I think go through the plan at least because then it will become difficult. I understand Khalid is important but I don't know if he's not available then yeah.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
I did tell him what the meetings apart and he said he ideally would want to be there, but maybe you I don't know.

Patel, Rahul:
Maybe you can speak to him about that meeting that you have scheduled. Let me talk to him at least. Thank you now. Yeah. Just for your information. OK, let's connect after this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, OK.

Patel, Rahul:
you you I'll jump on a quick call with Khaled while others are joining.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
you Kyle, while we're waiting for everyone to join, I was just classing with Khaled. I don't know if you know, they have something called SAP enabled normal, which we can leverage for training. I was asking him if we can start arranging access already. Who do you think will need access? Access from your team.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
I would like all of us to get access.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
I can send you the names.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, yes, please. OK, sure. Thanks.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Thank you. You you Hello, Tim.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Hector.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Where are you waiting for us?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, and also for Rahul.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
He joined, but then he had to answer a call with Khaled.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Bastian and Hector, I'm also requesting call it for access to SAP enable now for training whenever we get to that point, but it's good to have the access already and start looking at the system.

Hector Palacios:
Who from the OSM should I request access for? For S4HANA you say? For enable now.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Enable now, what is that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It will be used for training.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Enable now. They already have it in the landscape. So we plan to leverage the same system for drilling.

Hector Palacios:
That is for drilling. Then we should request for Arundh. And Sagar, obviously. Sagar is the main one for drilling.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
So not just trilling.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Not just trilling.

Hector Palacios:
Everything, all of IBP training.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
So it kind of integrates in standard with IBP, and there are a lot of pre-built videos in there for IBP. And then there's content that we can create as part of training.

Bastian Osorio:
But do we have to upload the content there?

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Yes. We're still in discussions with Khaled about the training approach. I've set up a meeting next week, Monday, to discuss it, but Khaled, he essentially wants us to use EnableNow where we would upload the training into EnableNow.

Bastian Osorio:
Then you can give access just to Rocio and she will upload all the content, but there's no need to add everyone to that. Interface. It would make it harder. Just add Rocio and we will centralize all the content through her.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
I think it's not just a matter of uploading content. It will use the platform to provide the training real-time on-ground. That's my understanding. Guys, I'm very lost with Enable now.

Hector Palacios:
So what we can do there is a repository, it's like a learning site, so I would need to understand better to tell you that, yeah, we need to involve all the consultants or if we know we need to go centralize. Is something that they can show us or do you have any?

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
So Khaled, I was speaking to him yesterday, he said that he would be able to set up a session where he can explain EnableNow to us and just show us the system to men at all.

Hector Palacios:
So I'm in the process of organizing that. Let's do that first and then we can tell them who can be accessing that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Patel, Rahul:
Hello, Rahul.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello, hello, hello. Hello.

Patel, Rahul:
So we can start integrating. Yeah, a lot of things are happening. We got clarity, at least some good clarity on drilling, I think. And then Kyle, I spoke to Khalid. He'll be available for our tomorrow's call. So let's continue.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, great. Thanks.

Patel, Rahul:
So Hector, now that the data is available, the MRO demand impact, how soon you will be able to confirm the impact? Because I was just talking to Khalid as well. And one of the point Khalid is also pushing us is that you guys are not involving maintenance people. You said that there is a change coming. Maintenance people are to be involved. Maintenance is a difficult audience to work with, and you're still not involved maintenance people.

 And if you're going into UT somewhere in the end of Jan, then how are we making sure that the maintenance stakeholders are onboarded? I did not talk to him, but this is an important point. We need to make sure that we align on this because it impacts a lot of different things. Identifying key users, planning the training, identifying total number of users, also identifying, also planning the sessions for demand.

 So if you're not planning sessions for demand, then we'll be questioned why we are not planning sessions for demand and only for inventory and supply. So that's where I just wanted to make sure we ourselves are aligned here, make sure that we understand the impact, and it's a big change in the process what we've discussed. So I just want to make sure that this change gets communicated smoothly and then we don't face resistance from AdNoc is the point I was trying to make.



Hector Palacios:
So we just aligned before this session we were with Basti and we are having a session today. In the afternoon we are putting the team together and we are going to do the first integration. We are going to do it at last level because there's location for the consumption history is not available yet. Indeed, we have a big question there if that's something that we can do. But we are going to do it flood level, and we will start analyzing the data, and we will check many things, the performance of the system between the fast movers, which ones can apply for a forecast, if there is any, and so on.

 So we need to do some calculation and to check if this is significant because if we check that less than one percent of the data can be available for forecast then maybe that is not something that we want to push, right? Yes, yes.

Patel, Rahul:
I'm completely aligned with your thought. The only thing is we have a lot many things in the next couple of weeks and then with this change we need to communicate this change in a very subtle way so that there is acceptance to what we are trying. At the same time I want to be completely align with what you guys recommend. So it's not that just because we already have a signed document does not mean we should not go back and change.

 It's just that whatever we propose should instill confidence and not give them a message that you guys only suggested this and now you're changing it. Are you sure what you want to do? Because AdNoc has been pretty aggressive about a lot of things and they immediately get back to us. Are you understanding our processes? Do you know our data? So we've heard these comments before, right?

Hector Palacios:
So I just want to make sure that we don't get similar comments. That's the way that we need to communicate is to say, yeah, we don't know your data. That's a problem. That's a problem. So we have to be, because you know that this should be, in a normal place, this is something that we have, like, from the beginning. This is not something really complicated to do. It's the first flows, material, location, customer, and the historical consumption.

 Are straightforward. And based on that, we take decisions. In this case, we push the integration. You see, we are in January. We started in September. And just in January, we have clarity of the data. We will be able to analyze it and to check. I know that the data, we have the data stream that maybe that's the problem. Because we have the data stream, but they were not able to analyze the historical consumption and so on.



Patel, Rahul:
So that was a problem. Exactly. We can see that. The interface was set up, so that's where. So I'm completely aligned. Let's strategize how we want to communicate this change, because it has impact on everything we do here onwards. And it's a big change, even if it is for MRO. And MRO is a critical stakeholder in the intercommunication. So while at one side, we are pushing them to get the key resources, I don't want to continue pushing it.

 Knowing that by week of 27th Jan, we are not planning to have that demand discussions.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, so let us work on this today. Between today and tomorrow, I can tell you a better date to say this is something that we can decide like on Monday or Tuesday. And otherwise, we are facing an issue. We need to solve this issue before giving you the answer, you know?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
I hope that there's no promises.

Patel, Rahul:
If it is an issue, it is an issue. Is outcome of the project activities the way it are happening. So I'm perfectly fine in just that. But more clarity we have, the sooner we have the more clarity, better decisions can be taken. And I'm aligned. Yeah. Yeah. So the only thing, Hector, probably if you need any help from me, Kunal, or Khushboo in terms of how the data is maintained in S4 HANA or want to align anything internally.

 Then we'll be available for any such discussion so do let us know if based upon your conversation internally if you need anything from us.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah I usually ask the guys to to go directly with you so when Vivek has a question really just for Hannah I'd say go with Cushbow with the whole in this case for Sagar probably the question will be how we can do the the iteration of the consumption history because the consumption history Safari, it seems that it's only at the plant level.

Bastian Osorio:
One more thing is about Buruj. What is the data? What are the products that we need to integrate from Buruj? Are the same ones that we have in the one ERP or different ones?

Patel, Rahul:
So, the material code will change, but the table the logic will not change.

Sheth, Kunal:
Rahul, to answer Bastian's point, for Buruj, we only have one plant, 3700, which we need to integrate in IBP. So if you need any help from my side for the Buruj system, I'm able to access. And I have also pinged to Sagar, and he was able to load for one ERP.

Patel, Rahul:
He just confirmed me. That's good news, that if you have only one plant, Are you sure we have only one plant from Buruj, Kunal?

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
That was confirmed by Nishant. OK, so they have only one plant in Buruj.

Sheth, Kunal:
The entire AGC has only one plant? Yeah, yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
3700 or something he confirmed when we do the activity last time with him. OK, let's proceed with it. Maybe in tomorrow's technical call, Kunal, you can again question this specific point. So for your information Kunal, tomorrow's technical meeting most of us will not be available because we have this change management discussion with Adnok. So we would request you to lead the technical call and then make sure this Buru generated point is discussed and documented.



Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Sure, sure, yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
Which technical meeting are we referring to Rahul? We have alternate days technical With the technical team only. Not so Kaiser, the infrastructure team, the Technical team. OK. OK, you don't have that invite? No, I don't have this invite.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Let me forward it.

Sheth, Kunal:
So tomorrow we will also initiate a discussion for the single sign-on for the CID Spark, which SAP has confirmed yesterday.

Patel, Rahul:
And we'll see how to take this forward. Yeah, yeah. So tomorrow's technical meeting, yeah, go ahead and have that conversation on how to do it internally as well as with Kaiser. The only point is, if we have done with the configuration of, say, non-prods, then do you want to go and do it right away just decide upon it.

Sheth, Kunal:
In non-prod we have only done for the one-time activity with the other user like Sagar but similarly for Kaiser, Kaiser should also be able to log in into CIDS without entering the username password so that is also one of

Patel, Rahul:
the ask. Agreed agreed but then just check with Sagar that this non-prod we need to add additional dev and other additional instances right so for every instance to be added every s4 box to be added it will need id password right so we cannot initiate the sso configuration on non-product unless all the non-product related activities with user id and password are completed correct correct yeah we need to mount the data store on cids for each activity which you need to do for yes yeah so that's That's the point.

 So while you can discuss and agree and align upon it, let's make sure that when we are doing it, we're doing it as a final activity. And Kunal, just to make sure that this becomes part of the cutover, remind this to Sagar as well. Yeah, yeah, sure.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, then I think we've discussed what we wanted to discuss, Hector. I hope everyone understand the impact of the change we are trying to bring in. Hector, are done with your internal analysis between today and tomorrow? Maybe let's connect on Monday and understand how we take this up.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
And another point related to the BRDA was seeing that they are placing many new requirements, especially Moodle. And they were just putting instead of comments, they are putting, no, we need to do this, this, and this. So how we take that? Because I don't want to do a quick answer. Many of them require some assessment. So can we put it as open points?

Patel, Rahul:
For sure. If we have not discussed this and we don't have time to discuss, that's what we'll be doing. We put everything in the open point. And that brings me to one more point, which we have discussed, is that Kunal, Khujbu, and the entire team, Bastian and Hector, while we're putting things in the open point, we need to make sure that all the points related to open points, which are documenting in BRD and BPD, are discussed, closed, documented, so that it should not happen that we put things in open points and then we don't get time to get back to the open ones.

 Yeah, for sure. So that's the only thing. But if there's anything specific, Hector, like all these are like completely new requirements which you never discussed? Yeah, some of them.

Hector Palacios:
The points that I'm leaving open, it's like that. Otherwise it's just I just comment and add into.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so whatever points you keep open, Kunal, let's review this. I will share in the chat.

Hector Palacios:
So let me go through them and I will go in the chat. There are some of them that are more like Boruch. There is one guy from Boruch that is always asking are we going to do this the same on Boruch because it went in a way but they all So I'm not clear on that. They said they are discussing about we do general planning with the WBS, something like that. And are we going to continue? I'm not clear on those points.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Patel, Rahul:
So that's what one of the points was discussed with Vignesh as well. Today, Vignesh had the same question on supply planning document, that for turnaround, how we are going to do planning. So if you remember in the turnaround planning, we've discussed that the work order type is separate for turnaround planning. But there's one more point in the work order we discussed is that the work order will have a WBS assignment, which means the stock which is created by the work order is project stock and not a free stock.

 That's for all the SAP system? For all SAP system, both Buruj one ERP, that whenever they create a turnaround order, in the turnaround order, there is a field where they can allocate a WBS element. So they do not create project, project plan, project hierarchy, anything. They just assign the WBS element into the turnaround work order so that when you create a supply plan for the turnaround work order, the supply plan should also have that specific WBS element and the PR gets created against the WBS element and the stock when when the goods receipt happens against the PR PO which is which has the allocation of WBS element the stock is created for that project WBS as a project stock and then it is issued to the work order so so basically the stock planning for for turnaround is order specific.



Hector Palacios:
Okay the point is that there will be WBS element, we have it at the beginning when we have the demand, but as soon as we go to stock PRs, we lose the visibility of that. We start working only at planning material. So, that's something that we need to check how to do. There is an additional complication. Murugan just confirmed that the storage location is not sufficient to determine what is preventive and what is turnaround.

 So, we cannot separate the supply chain network. That's the problem, because if we want to have different runs, different teams, we have to be able to separate the supply chain network in two, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Because otherwise they are sharing. So storage location between corrective preventive and turnaround? Because corrective preventive will not have separate storage location, turnaround will have separate storage location.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, I know.

Hector Palacios:
But I think that Muruan said that turnaround doesn't have a different storage location. Yeah, I think I will show you on the chat when I take that.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, because I think this was discussed in the meeting. Probably we can go back to the meeting script and share it with Murugan saying that we were told that turnaround planning is a separate planning. There are separate people and separate store location for turnaround. Yeah. But then, Hector, this WBS, you see the concern on supply side?

Hector Palacios:
The WBS? Yes, because for us, WBS is like the customer on our side. We have the visibility of the demand and what we can deliver to them. But when we are talking about the stock, we don't have that additional dimension. We have material and plant so far.

Patel, Rahul:
I think that this will become a risk for us because even Vignesh was expecting the same. So today only morning in the morning, you guys were not there. He pinged me, and we had a quick call. And that's what he explained. So I said we'll note this, and we'll communicate with the team internally. But I was hoping that WBS is something which is available on supply side. And when the PR gets created, the PR is with that WBS element assignment.

 So probably maybe if we are not going to have that, we need to clearly share this with AdNoc if it is something not possible. But if you can have a look at it, and check if this is something possible.

Hector Palacios:
The only way possible to do this, because the dimensions of the supply algorithms are closed. So you use material, location, customer, so on. But in the middle is basically material location. So one possible option to add a new dimension is to use the location as a concatenation. So you have the location slash WVS. Something like that. So that is a possibility. That is a possibility. It's like a workaround in the inputs, so you get what you need.

 But let's think it.

Patel, Rahul:
In the input, we'll be able to extract the WBS from the work order. So that information is there on the demand side. How we can leverage that information from demand side to supply side so that we don't lose the context and then use that information to create the purchase requisition?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah. If there is one-to-one relationship, then we can use the we have the material in location at the end you know or material vendor and we can like extrapolate the the wbs but that is under that assumption that is just

Patel, Rahul:
one wbs by material and location that may be not the case right no no it cannot be because same material can be part of four different work orders and every work order will have different wbs So essentially, it's not material level planning, but work order level planning.

Hector Palacios:
OK.

Patel, Rahul:
Because you will have one WPS for work order. And in one work order, you may have hundreds of material. And all those materials are required for that specific turnaround. So if you have a turnaround for the, say, December 2027, right? And if you're planning to create one work order for December 2027, or that December 2027, there will be budget, say $2 million is the budget for material planning. So they will create a work order with WBS and allocate $2 million budget to that WBS.

 And they will use that WBS assignment to the work order. So the moment the work order gets WBS allocation, so whatever is the cost of material of the work order will get qualified from a budget perspective. And then when you receive the material, the expectation is that because SAP will not be able to consume the material if the stock of the material is not on that WBS, which means for them to issue the material, the goods issue of the material to happen to that work order, the stock has to be on the WBS level.

 And for the stock has to be on the WBS level, this WBS level information has to be passed on to the purchase requisitions. If you are not able to create TR with WBS assignment, from IBP, then they will lose the context. And when the GR happens, the stock would be not project stock, but the stock would be unrestricted stock. And then if the stock is unrestricted, then they'll not be able to consume against the turnaround work order.



Hector Palacios:
Yeah. So it sounds like a lot. Let us think on that point.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Hector Palacios:
But for what I understand, it seems like more order-based planning than in So they are focusing on that.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, because the idea is that they will have turnaround for, say, one turnaround in two years, right? So the entire planning for the turnaround is having maybe one or two orders. So that is a specific turnaround. It is order-based planning, then material-based planning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, again.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, maybe we can do it with the location ID. The change that I was thinking of

Patel, Rahul:
I discussed with Vignesh that maybe we create, if Turnaround has a special storage location, then create that storage location as a location for Turnaround and all the planning happens at that location.

Hector Palacios:
So what you were aligning with Vignesh is that you were going to create a storage location or that they already exist for us to use?

Patel, Rahul:
I said that I understand so that's what I said to Bignesh that my understanding is there is separate location available for turnaround planning. Okay so that is the location is available then there is an opportunity to create a location in IBP for planning the turnaround. But then he was mentioning that Hector he was mentioning that you in the last meeting you have you told him right the plant would be so generally the location is the last level where you can have the material planning but then you said that plant would be created as a separate custom key figure and then the location would be at a storage location level right that's what you you mentioned so how this will change the overall design so what you are planning is that every plant would be created as a plant in idp as Yeah, I mean, the basic dimension for us needs to be one or the other.



Hector Palacios:
It can be the two. So for us, the basic dimension is the concatenation between plant and storage location, right? That is the location ID for us. And the location, the plant, is just an aggregation of that information. It's like an additional attribute on the table, but it's not the key.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, OK. So basically, essentially, then the concatenation between plant and location is nothing but, plant and storage location is nothing but the storage location. And then you will again create an additional attribute only for the hierarchy perspective, which is plant, but it's not a location in IVP.

Hector Palacios:
We can make some planning layers so that there is no limitation to do that kind of stuff. But as soon as we work with the algorithm, they're required to work with the keys, that in this case is the location ID. So if we run supply planning, it needs to be run at the storage location It cannot run at the location level, for example.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. OK.

Hector Palacios:
So that is going to be a limitation for us. We need to understand all this kind of stuff. So when we define lead times, everything in the supply chain network needs to point out to the right storage location.

Patel, Rahul:
I'm assuming that we'll have a lot more questions and sessions once you guys have a look at the data.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah. So we are just starting getting data from the, in general. So, Bastian, what he wants to do, and it's very, it's a very smart approach, is that instead of asking, asking hierarchies, filters, and so on, let's show what we get, how it is. And they will make sense of it. So we will start iterating. That's a better approach.

Patel, Rahul:
I agree.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, because we have lost most trying to ask them about hierarchies, and we have no answer.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so I think let's proceed with what we see from the data, what they've shared with us, like the data what we look at, and propose that. And if they don't like it, then we'll ask them what is to be changed.

Hector Palacios:
Exactly.

Hector Palacios:
Good. That's it from my side.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
From my side also, I don't have any further questions. Anyone have anything? Yes.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Can we take five more minutes to discuss EOQ and conclude? Yeah. Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Do we have Mo Fakhoury on this?

Patel, Rahul:
Can we pull Mo Fakhoury on this call? I just want to make sure we are aligned with Mo as well from a process perspective.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah. And Kyle, if you would like to drop, you can.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
All right, I'll drop.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, we have more on the call now.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah, I'm off.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No more.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Hello guys.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We pulled you into.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
We're just starting to discuss EOQ. We wanted to pick your brains also on it. Did you get a chance by the way to ask internally to check on EOQ how they're calculating the holding cost and operating ordering cost?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
So I did much talk to one of the One of the partners that did SAP IBP implementations, and he mentioned it is, and Hector here, correct me if I'm wrong, IBP will take the field for the minimum lot size. Now, whether it is EOQ or something else, it will always take that as the field.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. ...

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
In terms of ... Like ordering cost, it's, it's not ... Easy task to determine what the ordering cost is, like it's also ... Not easy to do, to determine a percentage. We just, we need to look at their materials, assess them, and then based, based on that, see if they have any fixed costs, and then determine that.

Hector Palacios:
Guys, it's complicated, because most of the order cost is not related to the material quantity per se. It's related to the frequency of order, basically. So there are a lot of cost. For example, if you need to transport one material 100 one time, or you need to transport 10 at a time, 10 times. So you're multiplying the cost by 10, because you are increasing the transportation costs every time, you know.

 So basically, yeah, the wages of the people that is doing the ordering, the purchase, you know, all of that is going into this cost. So yeah, this is a very complicated request for consultants like us, because we are not financial consultants. If we can provide something like, there is a how to say, I lost the terminology, but as a reference, we can say this is 10% of this or 12% of this, but how sure?

 We don't have certainty of that. We don't know more than them. So I don't know how to approach to this point, to be honest. For us, in a very basic, Guys, the basic is that they need to provide that input. So if they don't have it, then, well, we cannot do EOQ, basically. That's it. For supply planning, what is the point, then, is that you use lot for lot, and that's it. So this is mostly relevant for chemical, because for MRO, we have no data for calculating something like EOQ.

 Is for continuous cement. So that is the scenario for chemicals. For chemicals, if we don't have the EOQ, the best we can do is that it's lot for lot. So you are using this on demand, then we are going to supply this, basically that. And we can round up. If they have constraints, like lot sizes, as Mo was saying, we can use that as rounding values. But if they don't have the EOQ, then that is a limitation.

 I think that the chemicals are affected for the MRO. So EOQ was not going to work your way.

Patel, Rahul:
What I understand is they use max a lot. And for max, to be determined, it is basically your ROP plus EOQ by 2, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
But EOQ applies the formula. The assumption that that's formula that we have, that everyone knows, is that the demand It's like very frequent demand. So you can increase the volume and decrease the frequency or other way around. So one is the volume and the other is the frequency of ordering. In MRO, the two things are low. You have low frequency and low volume. We have like one, basically. So I think that indicates the order size.

 The usual order size for MRO should be one, right? Now, in the cases that is not like that, because we have seen the data and sometimes we have values like 100, 500, 800, you know, with that amount of information, the only thing that we can do is like a heuristic rule, like, well, we will take the maximum that you have seen in the history, and we will use that as a maximum. And that's it. It's the only thing that you can do when you don't have data to calculate.

 Things more sophisticated.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
OK, so from what I've checked, normally you can calculate ordering cost if you're maintaining purchasing conditions, pricing conditions. But again, it has to be checked with AdNoc if they are maintaining this or even using conditions in their purchase orders.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, but at this point I think what the request from AdNoc is that they want us to they want us to do the theoretical formula. They have acknowledged the data is not there in S4 HANA, which means the data has to be created directly in IPP. And they will ask users to maintain the data, not the EOQ directly, but the values required to calculate EOQ in IPP directly. So there will be a lot of manual input.

 And most of this ordering cost parameters are calculated on an annual basis, which means someone in AdNoc has to maintain the data on an annual frequency for the parameters which are required to calculate ordering costs. So the expectation from ADNOC is not to calculate EOQ automatically, but to define the requirement to calculate EOQ directly in IBP. And then that, and someone in ADNOC will update all the data manually so that the EOQ can get calculated.

 The reason why they are saying this is every group company has a different way of calculating EOQ. And we cannot take other input if we want to have consistent output in planning, which means the way of calculation of EOQ is required also has to be consistent across AdNoc. And for that reason, they're asking us as consultant is that you propose that, OK, if there is no data available in S4 HANA, we are not talking about interface.

 You propose what are the different parameters which should be considered in calculation of EOQ. Even if that data, when you say that it's not there in S4 HANA, fine. They will provide that input. But then they want us to propose all the different parameters, however complicated they are, to be considered as a requirement of input from AdNoc. This will give them ability to have a consistent way of calculating EOQ for all the group companies and that's the reason why Murugan is behind us to calculate this EOQ and S4 in IBP.



Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
So then, Rahul, can you share with them what I proposed on the MLDR today? Usually, for us, this kind of request, Rahul, is out of scope.

Hector Palacios:
I don't know the case of this project, but it's like a basic assumption that you will provide us the data that we need. In this case, they are trying to get us out of the scope of what we do usually, and to tell me what is the best theoretical formula for this. I'm not a financial consultant, man. So that's what I would say to others.

Patel, Rahul:
So when it is only probably Go-SM and your expertise is technical in a specific area, I guess you can say. But when someone like APMG, who is a consulting firm and who has parallel different, we cannot simply say no to this. So, that's the point they are pushing us on proposing this. So, before we say no to this, we need to be very clear why we are saying no, because then someone like Murugan, who has a lot of weight on to what we say in the project, will get escalated.

 So, that's why I'm putting this time, making sure all of us are aligned, and Mo, Fakury, that's where I thought I'll involve you, so that from a chain perspective, not only from an IBP, but as a business process perspective, how we can propose different, how we can share this to AdNoc that theoretically to calculate this inventory holding cost and then the procurement cost, what all different input a business should consider, and we can give this a theoretical formula to ad hoc so that they can agree to this.

 And then this can be considered as manual input, all the different input required for it as a manual input.

Hector Palacios:
Bahule, it has to say that KPMG is a big company, so we have a consultancy on many, many areas, I guess, between them, what we need. So it's something that we can escalate to Namanian to say, OK, we need expertise on this that we don't have here on the current team. This is not our scope.

Patel, Rahul:
So before I go to Namani, I just want to make sure that Mufakure, since he's from the processes team and supply chain team, if he can check within the network if this is something available readily. If it is not available, then we'll go to Mufakure and say, we need your support. How we take this up, whether we'll be able to get this information from someone from KPMG, or we go back to AdMob and say no.

 I don't just want to go directly to. I'd knock on the money before doing our work or our homework.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Also, I checked. I checked with the team even the team that is doing the logistics design. And I had not gotten us and they mentioned that that formula is standard. It doesn't. We cannot recommend a different formula. It's whether it is for oil and gas or it's manufacturing. Can you pull that formula?

Hector Palacios:
The formula is what it is. Here, regardless of the project, this is the theory that applies to all the cases. Now this formula applies only when this is continuous demand. That's something that we can say is the assumption behind the formula. For MRO, it doesn't apply, for sure. So MRO, completely different approach. It's more heuristic. There is no formula for that. It doesn't exist. For chemicals, yes, we can use this one.

 And these are the inputs. There's no other review of this. It's what it is.

Patel, Rahul:
So when we propose this to AdNoc, we'll put these disclaimers around that this is what we proposed to be used under these conditions. The point here is that we are not saying the formula has to be reinvented. The only point is that the demand is available in input, the holding cost can be a percentage which even Murugan agreed upon, the ordering cost something which is something we need to break down the way, the mechanism of calculating ordering cost and we say that there is this logic of What is ordering cost?

 Ordering cost is nothing but the fixed cost incurred by a company for every order, right? So if the fixed cost can be derived, normally how the fixed cost is derived? Yeah, so normally how the fixed cost is derived? The fixed cost is derived based upon the cost it is required by the overhead which are spent on procurement team, on the overhead which is spent on the quality team, the overhead which are spent and any other cost.

 So as a consulting firm, we need to recommend that, OK, for you to calculate the overhead cost, you need to consider these four or five different parameters. Now, we know for sure that those parameters are not available in IBP or SAP, and they will provide this input.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
So on the same point, Rahul, coming back to what I was talking about, purchasing pricing conditions. Now, in the system today, for example, if you can see my screen, They have conditions like operation fee created. They have conditions for free created and and this is as a value of as a value as a percentage of value as a fixed cost as well as quantity based. They have storage cost. They have all of these conditions defined.

 It's a matter of whether they use it or not, and that is the decision that we can lease up to add now to make.

Patel, Rahul:
I don't want to say that you tell me which are the conditions what is asking us, you tell us which of these conditions should be used for determining the purchasing cost. There are a lot of conditions.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Does all the condition apply for purchasing cost?

Patel, Rahul:
Operation and freight for sure. Are we sure freight is part of the purchasing cost? Because freight is a variable It's normally fixed based on supplier. Agreed, but then but then overhead cost is the EUK is calculated material and there can be four suppliers for a material and every supplier has a different freight cost depending on how far is from the facility, right? So it's still again a variable component.

 But what my suggestion is, that's the point I'm making is that The point I'm trying to drive is that what are different parameters should be considered as an input for calculating the procurement cost is something we need to recommend. Now, if we are clear on parameters like freight or operation, if we are sure on these parameters, then the next step is how to calculate the parameters.

Patel, Rahul:
While I agree to you, Khushboo, that these conditions are available and we can recommend that you can use this condition for maintenance. But even before that, we need to make sure that how many of these conditions are really applicable from a procurement cost perspective. And that's where business consulting will help us tell.

Sheth, Kunal:
Rahul, can we Basically, he's from the business consultancy practice part of finance team. He's an expert in this area.

Patel, Rahul:
That's where I was trying to connect with more and see if more you can use someone from your.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah, I would check if.

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, I would check. Gunjan is already serving his notice period, but still we can leverage him because he he has a good expertise in this area.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I'll check if.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, yeah, and the only thing is, once we have done our homework, then they and if you're still not able to conclude on this, then we'll take it to Mona money and say that. OK, we've tried this. We've connected internally. Even more quicker. You can try to connect internally. We do not have any input and this is the expectation for not help us manage this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
OK, yeah, give me. Today, I'll try to see if you can support us. Sure. OK, then I think we're done.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Just one last thing, Passion, if you had a chance or the team had the chance to look at the RICEV list, since we're getting close to unit testing now, we have to start ensuring that all of our RICEV are

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
covered in the building. Bastian? Sorry, I was talking as well in mute. Bastian probably is multitasking.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
What do you want to say to The RICEF list that I shared, did you or Bastián had a chance to go through it? Because we need to ensure we cover this as part of the build before we start unit testing, right?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah, we need to write it because we have many points on our side as well, so yeah, we need to bring all this RICEF point into our list as well.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah, we need to freeze it and also while we ensure that we are building it, we also need to cover the function and technical specifications.

Bastian Osorio:
I think we define a deadline for Monday. Okay. Isn't it? Yeah, Monday then. Okay, then we'll be working on that tomorrow and the idea is to provide at least a first review on Monday.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Okay, that's fine by me as long as it's on our Radar.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, perfect.

Hector Palacios:
Good guys, we love Rahul. He's also multitasking. So yeah, we need to jump to another session to configure it. Yeah, that would be all. Thank you. Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye. Bye-bye.
