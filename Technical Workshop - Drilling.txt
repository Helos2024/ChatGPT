And then we're going to jump directly into the master data structure that was defined based on the drilling workshop we had last week.\n\n And with that, the details of the integration, OK?

That way we can centralize all the information. This is the best way to read the data, because if we try to read the data from next from an excel file we're going to need to move the file to the data service agent server and create a custom workflow on on cids that have the same structure and the same name of the file that we are going to put in the server and are you sharing anything yeah no no I should still in the the three ways that we have to to data from a file.\n\n Okay, so the other thing that we can do is to create some custom table on IBP. Okay, that way we can upload the information into IBP directly and after that I can create a custom workflow on CID that read those tables and insert the information in the right key field that is needed. Those are the three ways of use of upload this information. We strongly recommend the first one because the first one centralizes all the information.\n\n To do the first one, we need to create a custom report on SAP that had the capability to upload the file into a custom table."},{"start_time":1730786886119,"end_time":1730786890875,"speaker":{"name":"Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"You have any diagram showing this?"},{"start_time":1730786890875,"end_time":1730786898802,"speaker":{"name":"Reinaldo Gutierrez"},"words":"No, I didn't have the duplicate one, but let me."},{"start_time":1730786898802,"end_time":1730786939622,"speaker":{"name":"Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"So the first one is your is saying that you need to do is to create a table in SAP S4 HANA and upload the data there and from there through CIDS you are going to read it.

Can you see my screen? Yeah, I can see your screen. So basically, we define two ways to upload the forecast. The first way, so here we have a plant and within that plant we have of course different wells that are link up well we haven't just put it here like here like like wells but there are in reality functional locations okay or cost centers in idv sorry in in s4hana that's that that was our understanding please correct me if I'm wrong okay so we have two ways of upload the forecast the first one is is to upload the forecast, assign the forecast directly to a well, meaning a functional location, okay?\n\n And this is called a DVC demand, okay? So within, I mean, the hierarchy for the wells is the field. So we can have multiples wells that are part of the same field.

I think we should, we might, yeah, we could use both options. Second option is that instead of loading the demand directly into the the fields with the products, we load the BOM. Here, I symbolized it by this square BOM header. We need to define how we're going to call this master data. But here, instead of loading the demand right away, what we load is the BOM, and then we load the well plan.\n\n When we're going to use this bomb. And this, within the system, will generate automatically the demand of the finish of the materials. And then with all that information, we can see an aggregate plant level forecast, which is one of the requirements. So let me go to an Excel sheet.

I don't know how we're going to call it cost center or functional location. For us, it's kind of the same. I mean, it's not the same, but the relationship is one-to-one. So for one functional location, you have one cost center. So then we need the relationship between the planning, the cost, and the well, right?\n\n Because a well has to be attached to a attach or link to just one plant. I think this will be also part of something we need, but that is not yet I'm not sure, Rahul, if this is in the file."},{"start_time":1730787699588,"end_time":1730787708820,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"We can check and confirm if it is part of the file."},{"start_time":1730787708820,"end_time":1730787715743,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Let me check while you are working on it."},{"start_time":1730787715743,"end_time":1730787747617,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Why do we need this? Well, because the system has a logic that needs this. But moreover, on the top of that, one of the requirements is to be able to look at the forecast at a plant level. And for doing that, we need the relationship between the wells and the plant. The plant cannot be isolated."},{"start_time":1730787750614,"end_time":1730787774600,"speaker":{"name":"Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Yeah, so I think the other day we clearly discussed that functional locations are created. It's just that the functional locations are created later stage. We need to align that at what point functional location would be created so that it can be extracted from S4 HANA.

They are estimating, they are estimating differently for the different plans. They had one for JV. I'm sure I saw that they had, you know, they had, you know, a sub.

So, especially the DBC, the calendar plan, both onshore and offshore, we can get it from system.

So, they didn't name it actually.\n\n This well, we didn't get any name so far. So, whenever they do mapping, they'll give you a provision well. This is called the provision well.

We can see you want to reshare. I'll do it once again. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah The sheet name so they have very detailed drawing and all they provide this I'll go through later So this is the combination code to be so this is the if almost shift to be necessary to be lower second to be it will be the same sheet and This is a serial number 1 2 3 4. So this is the basket serial number Then you have the this code they provide in the very beginning Okay.\n\n So now the same thing we captured in the system as a old material number so to track completely. This was we used during tendering phase. This is the quantity required per well. And sometime we can find zero in this quantity, means that's optional. You want to capture, but it's optional. And when it's less than one, the major... Less than one, yeah, 0.1 and all, it will be like they put multiple wells.\n\n Okay. And so anyhow, so we'll get more clarity later on with the team, so the quantity side, part of it. However, we can just go through the mapping part of it. So, this is the old material number in SAP. Last time we saw the two numbers, start with the W. W is nothing but for Weatherford, this one supplier. So, Weatherford have, they have the unique number. These are the material number for Weatherford in SAP.\n\n And this is for Schrodinger, start with S. This is the material code for the This is the description for the weather fort, it will be the unique description for the weather fort and this is the unique description for the Shambhaja at the end. So sometime almost same, sometime it might be different. So basically this is the mapping and so we have two suppliers here. Ah what we propose last time we want to do the planning in the branded material number level because it is already in the VMI and now what we ah we have to ask them what is the distribution methodology by field or whatever.\n\n So, this one I will obtain from the drilling team. So, which one which code to use.

Now let's go to, this is the BOQ, this is the one of the table and so we'll see how we can do the drill down and all later on. So this is the next one, DBC well plan. I'll share once again this one with the material number. This is the DBC well plan. Here we have same thing what we discussed, we have field and all. So we will go to the same example here, the completion code 2B.\n\n So there is a 2B NS and 2B. So the 2B NS later on will come back. So this is the 2B. We have how many wells here 2B? 99 wells and it is available in two fields, Dover Zakum and Umurshif. And these are the dates. It starts from where is from already done 22 and up to 29 we have the plan and the information here so the main one what we have to take it one is well type this is water injector and that's what we have seen something we need this important and completion code is important and field is important.\n\n So this is for the mapping to the like BOQ.

That's the reason we want to bring all this table information here.\n\n So, they might require sometime by rig they will come here and see what What are the things for albizum?

So however so Zadko is not valid company otherwise Aliasat is the valid company code and Zadko Adnok Offshore drilling on behalf of Aliasat.\n\n So here you can see the SS what we have seen before. So it will come under the either Aliasat or some second, maybe in the ASR. It's called Silsila. Yeah, SS under the offshore joint venture. Under Busikin, Tower Busikin, SOP4. Okay, this is the island actually. So, this is a land rig. So, this is they're putting under the rig and they put it to SAR island actually.

So one of the good report in theory they prepared for us. So you can find some quantity they already ordered and so which is available under the PO. This information what is available in the PO it means so it's from the vendor and we have one sheet which is we'll get it from the vendor.\n\n In excel sheet the available quantity in the vendor.

So, we have 3 type of pavement mechanism.

So somewhere we want to see from the information we want to capture what quantity available in vendor so they will provide an excel sheet.\n\n And so the PO this also we can connect it and this all information we can plug it in now. So whatever the information available in SAP you can bring So for example, the outstanding PO, outstanding like sometime it's under the unknown custody. Maybe it is with us.

Both are Umushif now.\n\n So the client code is same I think 1401 for both the vendors. So there will be a differentiation and so we have to use this different plan code actually.

Yeah, for sure."},{"start_time":1730794083504,"end_time":1730794094442,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"I just want to know what you are going to upload into the SAP.

So I'm going to show you. Ways that we can do it. This is the first way that we can do it. But we also have the other way that is from the file to IBP. So what we're doing here is that we are going to take the file, move it to the data service agent. From the data service agent, we are going to create a custom workflow and that way we are going to upload this information into IBP.\n\n For this, we will move the the file manually into the DSAA server. Obviously, it will require a custom workflow with the same structure as the file, and the file needs to have the same names always. This is like the option that we will not recommend to use. The other one that you asked is the file into IVP. So, this is the one. We can create some template on IBP, and we can upload this information into those templates that are going to exist on IBP.\n\n From there, we can create a custom workflow, and the workflow is going to be IBP into IBP, and that way we can insert this information into the master data that is required for the process. I will send you guys this structure, that way you can have the idea of how we are going to manage this information. But the auction tree, I think is the best, because you guys already have this information in Excel, so we need to create and get into agreement of what are those fields that we are going to use in IVP.\n\n And just upload that information to IBP. But you have to remember that on IBP, we cannot use macros. So it's like we have that restriction there."},{"start_time":1730794253739,"end_time":1730794254307,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"OK?"},{"start_time":1730794254307,"end_time":1730794259421,"speaker":{"name":"Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"The file we are uploading should not have macros."},{"start_time":1730794259421,"end_time":1730794265103,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"This is what you mean to say, right?

From IBP is that generally the master data should come from one source system, which is SAP. Now, if you're directly uploading anything in IBP, which means we may have a situation where we are creating master data outside of SAP directly. And it may create inconsistencies between what is there in SAP versus what is there in IBP because we are directly reading from a file."},{"start_time":1730794293872,"end_time":1730794325995,"speaker":{"name":"Reinaldo Gutierrez"},"words":"Yeah, that will happen. But if we use the third option, this last option, we are not going to have that problem because we are going to upload those files into a template. If when the workflow that is going to insert that information into the master data and the key figures have something like error, we are going to review the information that we already employed in the template so we can correct there and then execute again the workflow.\n\n"},{"start_time":1730794326605,"end_time":1730794374988,"speaker":{"name":"Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"So I think, Reinaldo, we can discuss about this data upload as part of the follow-up discussion.

So any point they can see whether the well is feasible or not. Maybe it's in 25 or 26. So it's management asking in 2027 this well is feasible or not.\n\n So maybe the 27 is already covered under the VMI. They can say this much VMI and this much they have to order.

So maybe we already issued the PO, or we issued the PO before.\n\n And some wells get canceled, or the particular well itself postponed to 2027. That means this well is basically material-wise is covered. So whenever they want to display one well, particular one, 2027, in all aspects, whether the bill of material, then how the supply sufficiency, for example, this available in stock at the day. Maybe this is all leftover material, some material still there, and some material in the PO release already there that can be delivered.\n\n And this is the action for the company. You want to issue the PO release, this many item, this many quantity to serve this well. This is basically what the planning user, drilling end user, they're looking for the long-term plan basis. This is one point of view. Second point of view, the short-term plan, like they want to create a reservation. So they can come here.
