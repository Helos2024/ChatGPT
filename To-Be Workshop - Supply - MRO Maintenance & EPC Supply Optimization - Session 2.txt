If you are having questions, just please raise your hands and we can go back to that discussion if needed. So, what we want to explain that is a supply planning model that is going to happen on AP. Do know that there are many algorithms, they are just different level of complexity. For you, it should be transparent that we have many options behind, and depending on the needs, we are going to use the appropriate algorithm on IVP, but there are many, from very simple ones to very complex ones.\n\n Here, what I want you to understand is that we have our supply chain network that is starting from the vendors, then you have your plants, the storage locations, and finally, inside Some of them you will have the assets that are basically the consumption points. We have three important things here to see are going to be our demand needs, our sources of supply, and the supply chain constraints. All of this is going to be fed into the model, and the model will generate, as we said before, the procurement plan, that is the BRs, the stock transfers, and so on, based on all these inputs that you are"},{"start_time":1731576376595,"end_time":1731576377315,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"seeing here."},{"start_time":1731576377315,"end_time":1731576842112,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"There can be more. This is just an initial point. Just based on what we are hearing from you, we can say, okay, we need to use this additional input. But as a starting point, just not to overwhelm with all the possibilities, we are starting with this. Demand needs, we are going to have the forecast. As previously mentioned, this is something that we get from the demand side the process. For correct maintenance, the system can generate a statistical forecast or we are going to consider the maintenance plans that also will bring some material requirements.\n\n Then in the inventory model, we will bring the safety stock. That is also going to be a need that we need to fulfill in the system. It's an inventory need, but for us it's like a demand need as well that the system needs to fulfill. In many cases, suggest that the reorder point is also a demanding because this will trigger basically the replenishment. So this will be our demand sign-up, let's say, to trigger.\n\n On the other hand, we have the sources of supply. For sure, always the first source of supply is what we already have in place, the stock on hand, for example, the physical stock. So whenever we can, we are going to use as a first approach to fulfill any demand demand is going to be what we have. If we don't have enough stock, then the system should consider what is already coming, like a stock transfer between plants, or should propose, based on the information that is available, knowing that we have excess inventory on one place, to move – the system should trigger a proposal from one plant to another plant, or a storage location Finally, if we cannot do that, if we don't have enough stock at the ad-hoc level, then we should trigger a vendor procurement.\n\n This is the order of the sources of supply always on the model. All of this need to be done respecting all the supply chain constraint that we have. We have some hard constraints that are basically what they are. We cannot change them. The system need to restrict to respect these constraints, and if we are not able to fulfill the consumption or the demand because of this, that is going to be the case.\n\n There are some constraints, some constraints that maybe we want to respect, but only if possible. If it is not possible, then the system will propose not respecting these constraints. And finally, we also can put priorities into the system. In a bit. So, the constraints, of course, we have the lifetime, that is basic. We will have also load sizes. So, if one vendor is selling you some materials, but in certain quantities, we are going to create procurement or, sorry, FPRs respecting that, that only we buy five and five, you know, not two, not four, between five, 10, 15, so on.\n\n That the log size is going to be a very important input. If we have any constraint on how much a supplier, for example, can give us in a month, in a week, and so on, that is something that also we can model on the system. So whenever we create a plan of PRs, we are respecting that and we are not generating PRs that in reality are not feasible. It's important that if we find any kind of constraints, if you have it on mind, please raise a hand and tell us.\n\n No, we cannot buy all we want from this vendor. We need to go to the other one and so on. If there are such constraints, we need to model in the system. Storage capacities. I understand that for offshore, we have many of them that we have limited capacity, so we cannot schedule whatever quantity we want as a stock transfer or procurement because we have limited capacity and we need to respect that constraint.\n\n Plan calendars as well. If we cannot receive on every week, every month, then we can put that. It's just an option. Of course, maybe you don't see a use case for this because the granularity of our plan is in months, in years, but If we find such a constraint, we can also use it. And present horizon, that means that for the near horizon, maybe we don't want to have any proposal for the system. And we should respect whatever we have today.\n\n So if we have such cases, we can model the system that maybe for the next two months. I'm saying something maybe doesn't make sense. But for the next two months, the system is not going to propose anything new. After the month plus three, we can have new proposal from the system. In the first two months, you have more stability. We are not going to propose anything new. It's a possibility. Not necessarily it's going to be more into the system.\n\n Then we have some constraints. One of them are sourcing quotas. This is when we have multi-sourcing. So imagine that this storage location slash plan this can be supplied from multiple vendors. We can define in which proportion. You're going to say in 40 percent, we are going to buy from here, or we are going to buy 40 percent, 60 percent, or 50 and 50, or 30 and 70, and so on. You understand the point.\n\n We can define that. The system will try to respect that, but of course, it's not going to be perfect because it depends on all things like the log sizes. Sometimes the percentages that we want to achieve are just not feasible because of the log sizes. Planner adjustments. So one thing that is very important to understand of IVP in general is that IVP proposes, but the planner can always adjust numbers.\n\n So if the IBP is proposing you to do one stock transfer of 10, you can modify to 12. We run the algorithm again. And the system will tell you it is possible what you are asking or it's not. So you don't have the fulfillment that you are expecting. So it's something that we can try to trigger into the system but not necessarily is going to happen because it depends that if we have enough lead time to get on time and so on.\n\n There are some hard constraints like I said that cannot be just disregarded. Finally, we have priority. Remember that, for example, I was saying about quotas. If we have multi-source plans from different vendors, we can say 40 percent from vendor A and 60 percent from vendor B. That can be one scenario, but we also can define priorities. You can say, give me everything you get from vendor A because the material is higher quality or is cheaper and unless I have a capacity from vendor A, I will go with vendor B.\n\n I will get all I can from vendor A and then whatever is left in that I cannot fulfill from vendor A, I will go with the second option."},{"start_time":1731576842112,"end_time":1731576844671,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"That is an opportunity as well."},{"start_time":1731576844671,"end_time":1731576878608,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Also with this functionality, for example, for procurement priority, we can define that whenever possible, we need to fulfill our demand from the plants if they have excess inventory, that means an internal procurement.

First of all, we're proposing a more comprehensive approach that offers different alternatives depending on the type of material. We're going to dive into how we will determine which one of the replenishment choice we will use, but here we are just presenting them. First, we have a reorder point, which is basically when your stock is less than your reorder point, you order based on maximum.\n\n That's pretty straightforward. You already know this. There's no need to go further into this explanation. Just one remark here. Remember, we are not using forecast. Even though we are creating the forecast in the demand planning to have a visualization of how much we will consume, we are not going to use it as a signal, as a triggering for buying. What we will use as an input is what we are seeing here, the inventory plan, the inventory policies, okay?\n\n And here, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the main value added of IVP for reorder point calculation with advanced algorithms for the inventory policy. If we go to the next one, advanced supply planning, here is more sophisticated. So here, of course, we have the inventory policy, which comes from the output the inventory algorithms, but we also have demand planning. We can even expand on demand planning, saying that, of course, we will have a demand that is coming from the preventive activities, and we also have which is a plan.\n\n It's not something that is forecasted. It's a reality. I will perform this maintenance activity in this equipment, and that will require these materials. Is confirmed. But along with that, we also have a forecast for the corrective maintenance that is generated through, again, advanced algorithms, but using as the main input the actual consumption for corrective maintenance. So we're going to combine these two demand elements along with the inventory policy.\n\n And with that, And all the operation constraints, as mentioned earlier, load sizes, lead times, and also the different movement between plants and vendor quotas, we're going to generate the final STRs and PRs. So I think along with that, I forgot to mention one more value value added of reorder point, which is currently in the MRP. Of course, if there is no source of supply, if your stock falls below your reorder point, you trigger the order, right?\n\n In this case, IDP will analyze, will assess the possibility of retrieve of sending materials from a different location. So there's two, I said there's at least, in this just glance, we have two differences for reorder point. First, the inventory calculation, and second, the possibility of moving stock across different locations, okay? So now we're gonna jump into the next slides where we're gonna talk about how, when, and how we're gonna use one or the other, okay?\n\n So in this table, we have basically the scenario, the priority, the recommended action, and then the reason, the rationale, basically. So the idea here is that I follow the priority 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera. And based on this rule, I will determine what is replenished management choice to be used. So, first, if the material has preventive maintenance, if the material is used as a component for preventive activities, then we have to use advanced plant planning right away.\n\n Check. Then, if the material has very low consumption frequency and no plant preventive maintenance, then we use reorder point. If, then again, if the material is critical, with considerable consumption, then we advance supply planning. Long lead times, advance supply planning. This is a key point. Why use advance supply planning for long lead times? Because we cannot expect the stock to lower than the reorbit point to place the order, because this will basically put on risk the stock.\n\n We will be on risk of stock out for material. We saw it's a long lead time. What is a long lead time? We need to define that with you. What is a long lead time? One year, two years, eight months? It's an open discussion. Then high inventory cost. We are in six. High inventory cost is advanced planning. Why? Because, so if you know when you drop, when you've, in pre-order point, when the order, when the procurement is triggered, go directly to max, right?\n\n There's like on off. You buy, you buy max, till max. But with advanced planning, we have more, we have, it's more, nuance. We have more space."},{"start_time":1731577320621,"end_time":1731577323519,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"We are trying to get it on time."},{"start_time":1731577323519,"end_time":1731577376511,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Yeah, we're trying to get it on time and in the same amount that we need. So for very expensive items, it has a value added of not buying more than you need. And then for low cost, high volume, reorder point. Because in general, for high volumes, we have a very stable demand pattern. So if you have stable demand pattern, and the system, you consume it a lot, then you don't need to forecast. You just replenish once it falls a certain threshold, right?\n\n And finally, for short lead time, the rationale is almost the same than the last one. You can replenish very quickly, so there's no need to put too much Anticipation. Anticipation and two months thought about this, OK?"},{"start_time":1731577376511,"end_time":1731577436060,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"The important part is to understand that we go to the next one only if the previous one is not fulfilled. So if we are saying long lead times, that's only after discarding. This is not a low frequency material. If it is a low frequency, then it's not a low-braining. Reorder point is going to be the best solution. That is going to be most of the cases that we were mentioning before. Like the mid-mover were like 70% of the cases, reorder point will continue to be the best approach.\n\n Maybe on the system we can have more advanced functionalities. Maybe we can complement with one other constraint. But the trigger, what is important part, is not going to be a forecast. It's going to be the real concern. So we drop below reorder point. We trigger the PR.

We know a lot about Excel, it's very general, and IDP is going to use all that existing knowledge, but it's going to connect this to the Cloud. The Cloud is basically another server that can be in another part of the world, but all your planning information is going to be there in that server.\n\n Here, we just need to have an extension of IDP, like a user and password, and we can access directly to an ID. We can input information to the system and it's going to be to the Cloud. We can download information from the Cloud and so on by just pressing this refresh button, and this is going to be connected on real-time for all the users. Today, you do a change, your co-worker just need to press refresh and he will see right away the changes that you are doing.\n\n This enables that you can collaborate and work at the same time into the system with the most updated information always. This is the Excel environment. Here you will have different key figures that are going to be defining the model. Sorry, the different dimensions that are the key figures, the attributes or hierarchies, and also, of course, the time, Let me make it just a little bigger in case that you are struggling seeing the letters.\n\n So key figures are going to be all the inputs, all the outputs, all the intermediate information. I will give you a simple example. The stock projection is going to be a key figure. Demand forecast is going to be a key figure. PRs are going to be a key figure, et cetera. So all the information that depends on the time is going to be a key figure on the system. Then to define the detail level at which we are seeing the information, at which we are planning, we have the attributes.\n\n So attributes are going to be your plans or storage locations, are going to be your materials, your maintenance plans, your assets, all that information is going to be a basic planning dimension that we will use on the system. We saw one prior slide when we showed the basic dimensional mass data is exactly that. Also, we will have additional information related to them, like hierarchies that we can use to consolidate the information in dashboards and to summarize in a smart way so you can take decisions or you can draw conclusions out of your resource.\n\n All of this that you are seeing here is something that can be customizable. At the beginning on every project, we will define some templates, but after you receive the template, you can customize it, you can change the filters, you can change the key figures you want to see, you can change the granularity of the time, and so on. You need to sync on this like a Bible table. If you are used to use that functionality next to the Bible tables, behind you have a cube of information, it's just a table, with all the information we need.\n\n But in the pivot table, you can define if I want to see at a high level, very consolidated. If I want to see this or that, you can filter the information you want to see and so on. This is exactly the same concept you have behind a huge cube of information, that is how we call it. There is a lot of very detailed data in the background, but then in the planning view, you will define at which level you want to see it and what you want to see.\n\n In the Excel, you will have this functionality in which you can define what are going to be the planning dimension you want to see. For example, the horizon, you can change between months, quarters, years, even weeks, if that makes sense. The attributes that you want to see, you can just grab, move. You see that if you want to bring another like FMCN, you just grab it, you put it there, you will have it on the view.\n\n We will have a huge source of key figures that during the implementation probably we will be reducing this to have only visibility to what is important to us. All of the other is not a set of standard key fields that maybe we are not going to use on this implementation. We need to hide it and you will see only what is relevant for you. Then you can choose what you want to see. On the planning view.\n\n So you can make your own reports if you want, and so on. Layout, if you want to move information between columns and rows. And filters, at the end, not less important. You can filter the information. So if you want to see one specific AEC, then you can use the proper field that I've seen that we have something right there just to illustrate. We are going to trigger anything, but ultimately, in the future, you will have something like this.\n\n If you have access to see information from many AGCs and you can filter only the one that you want. In our cases, probably you would see only what is relevant for you. Also, we can confirm the system alert. Whenever we have an exception or anything like that on the system, it's going to be highlighted. You can see some of them here in a few, hopefully, minutes. Abhashyan is going to showcase a case related to the others.\n\n Can you introduce the key parameters like lead time, criticality, and movement?"},{"start_time":1731579300605,"end_time":1731579313634,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Yeah, for sure, for sure.

In the meantime, let me show you your flavors of IVP. I was saying at the beginning that this is Excel-based, but this is also web-based. On the web, we have this environment that can be very familiar to you. This is Fiori. Is basically the application, the environment that SAP is using for many application between them as for HANA. So IP is going to use the same environment.\n\n Every child that you have here is an application. Right now, I have admin permission, so I see everything. In your case, when you enter to the system, you will see only the proper applications to what is going to be your job. What is happening here? Basically all the configuration. All the entities that we need to define as consultants, you will see it here. All the jobs that we need to define the algorithms are going to be here as well.\n\n We are going to put parameters and so on. But mostly what is going to be important for you for sure is going to be visualization. Here we have one a very simple example because as we are saying, we just want to showcase functionality. There is a long road to start all the configuration that takes for sure time and depends on the definitions as well. But here, what I want to show you is that as you see planning views on the Excel, you can have the same on the web part.\n\n If for you is more comfortable, let's say to work here instead of the Excel, you can do it. One of the main advantages is that you you can have not only the numbers here, but also you can have really quick visualization. So if you are changing any scene or if you're running an algorithm, you can see right away how these charts are going to be affected. In this case, a very simple example is the stock projection, the minimum stock that we should have.\n\n It's just something so you can see the type of visualization that we can have on the system."},{"start_time":1731579514755,"end_time":1731579527943,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"All right?

So this is like the mixed round, let's say, because on the Excel it's probably more related to the numbers. Here we are in the middle ground where we see numbers, but also we see dashboard. Then we have the other extreme where we can build full visualization.\n\n Then we have some functionality that, of course, given the earliest stage of the break, we cannot show you with proper data because we have too little data to show. But then later in the future, do know that you will have some advanced visualization. Which you can create. This is called analytic story, so it means that you can use charts and create a story with different pages. You can put text here and you can put the appropriate charts so you can go visualizing the most important aspects of your planning, this in volume, in value.\n\n I'm just showcasing here the different scenes as you do the different type of charts, bars, of course, is going to be a given. You can have even dispersion charts like the ones you can configure with advanced analytics tools. If we want to see an alert, probably we will see like a heat map, something like this, and so on. This is something that in the future we will be configuring for you as soon as we are able to We can start iterating to see.\n\n We are going to start for sure from a starting point, but later after that, I'm sure that there are many visualizations that you will want to have on the system. We just need to agree on what is the smartest way to see it, the simple way in which I can see to this and draw a conclusion, and you will have it on the system. We'll enable the discussions and we'll share in the same planning. So sometimes it's better, not sometimes.\n\n In most of the cases, it's very, very useful to see the values in charts than just numbers."},{"start_time":1731579666336,"end_time":1731579677911,"speaker":{"name":"Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP)"},"words":"Okay.

Always with the opportunity of course because the planner it will be the final word so the system will show you all the proposals then the planner is the ultimate word he can say I accept this or I need to review it and adjust it.\n\n Also, with the exception management part of IDP, we will show alerts in this tool where the user can focus. These are the weird scenarios. These are two different to what we have today. Let's review it. Let's review the proposal of the system. Let's focus on that.

More in the later stages on the project, the changes are going to be minimal. So, that is the approach. So, here we have a view that we are preparing for showcase the supply planning part. At the beginning, we have what are our needs. We have in these white tabs, as we were saying, we will have demand needs.\n\n One are going to come from correcting maintenance and another for preventing maintenance.

So we need to fulfill the demand that we are going to get from the first tab. We need to fulfill the minimum stock that is going to be a safety stock recommended by the system. This is something that we bring from the inventory module with inventory algorithms. And it's going to propose a safety stock in this case. Then we will have some tasks where we have the stock balance, what is entering to the storage location, what is leaving the storage location, what we already have in the storage location.\n\n All the orders that are on place and so on are going to play a role here to have the stock projection. Also related to that, we will have the stock transfers. Sorry for that. So we will have the stock transfers that the system can propose to transfer from one plant to the other. We have the purchase. One second. Let me close this. You have the purchase plan that the system is going to propose as procurement over what we already have in place.\n\n And finally, we will have the demand fulfillment. I don't know what this is. Triggering but it's not going to happen again because we are not going to refresh it again. Finally, we have also the amount fulfilling because it's important to understand that sometimes given the constraints, we are not going to be able to fulfill all that we are requesting regardless of the source of the demand. Let's go with the first one.\n\n In the first one, we want to showcase that there are different sources of demand. As we were saying at the beginning, we will have correcting maintenance and preventing maintenance. For correcting maintenance, you have this first key here. This is coming from the demand side of the process in which, as we were saying, we will create a statistical forecast that then later the user can review or not.\n\n After this forecast is approved, it's going to be used or released for supply planning and can be considered as an input. To go through an approval process when it's approved, then we can use it for the planning because it's a feature. The point is that, especially at the beginning, at the short term, we have some reservations, right? So we need to try to mix these two words. We have on one side what is our forecast, but then in the other side, we have something more certain that are the material reservations.\n\n So the point is that what is supply planning going to use to three-year the replanning and which one. So for avoiding what we were seeing at the beginning to double count because say here we have two demand signers we cannot consider the two of them because there is an overlap between them. So we were forecasting at the beginning let's say three units that we are going to need in that month. In reality it happens that we had a reservation by five so that is most real demand.\n\n That is what is happening, right? So, in the first period, we are going to consider that. Now, it's important to understand that the demand that we are having is higher than expected, so we need to consume the forecast to the future. So, what the system is doing here, you have three. In reality, you are using five. So, there are two more that you should consume from the future, So the system will look at the future demand, and in the following forecast period, it will reduce the forecast as well to account for that.\n\n At the end, the total demand for the next two periods is going to be seven, but it's being reshaped. You see that the seven up there below is all seven. It's being reshaped by the real data. So that is how the reservations are going to play a role to adjust our forecast to account for what is happening right now."},{"start_time":1731580222142,"end_time":1731580238042,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"We need a confirmation from your part first that the example is understood and second one that this is the logic for reservations.

If anything looks weird from past period to this period, the system will trigger an alert right away. Let's give you maybe a super simple example.

So when you use MRP with the order point, it is a reactive approach. When you say reactive approach, once you consume the inventory, you trigger procurement, which means you are not planning for inventory, you're planning for stock. And as the stock gets consumed, you react to the changing stock. That's the primary difference between IBP and S4 HANA, where we are not trying to have a reactive approach, but we are trying to have a proactive approach, where we are trying to predict when the stock will get consumed and not wait for the stock to get consumed.\n\n That's the one primary difference. Second difference is, once you understand that you have to procure something, MRP is limited by the stocks available in the current location only, whereas IVP is not limited by the visibility of material available in the current location. Has visibility of material available in all different locations which are relevant for that stock, which means one thing is you are more predictive when you need material.\n\n Second, you also know where the material is lying so that you don't need to buy every time from outside vendor. You can optimize the stock within AdNoc, within group company within the related locations to make sure that first I know when I need material second I know from where I can take the metal I don't need to buy it from vendor always and then transparency of this information across uh uh materials with the use of alerts which means you prioritize your effort on the critical materials with this two uh powers is will where IPP will help which MRP does not have this capability?\n\n"},{"start_time":1731582133612,"end_time":1731582170408,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Just to be clear, we are not saying that that reactive approach is going to be disrewarded. Indeed, on the slides, we were discussing in which scenarios it is good to have the advanced supply planning and be proactive, like to trigger procurement based on a forecast.

There is no point trying to anticipate that very low frequency with a reorder point based on consumption is going to be okay.\n\n"},{"start_time":1731582170408,"end_time":1731582258301,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So what I can tell you guys is that we understand the inhibition to be able to, since you are using MRP for so many years, your thought process, probably you are not getting the confidence, what difference IDP is bringing. So what we would say is help us. We understand this. Let us say set this baseline in terms of what we want to configure in IBP and then with actual data, let's review together that.\n\n This is how it is happening today. Compare that what IBP is proposing with their actual data and you will see the difference and you can take the decision of whether the difference which IBP is proposed versus what we we are using with MRP, is there any difference? That we will only be able to do when we agree on the process, use IDP to configure this process, and then we integrate your data and compare.\n\n So that is something we want to do as the next phase of the project. At this point of time, we do not have the data or the system ready to give you the confidence what you need right now, but we need to agree upon the baseline process that yes, this process makes sense.

Create consumption because user there is this behavior from the user that they will create reservation, but they will not end up consuming it, which means we trust consumption more than reservation is the one side of the story.\n\n And on the other side of story, we say that we trust reservation more than consumption because reservation is an approved object. Now, both cannot be true at the same time, which means we have an opportunity to see if the tool predicts better as per the consumption and not as per the reservation. And then if we have this confidence, then we can configure the tool to not to consider reservation if we trust more the forecast from the tool and make sure the stock is available at the forecast.\n\n So there is an opportunity, but then we can only show this when the tool is configured with your data so that you can confirm that historically, what was the reservation? Historically, what was the consumption? And for the same material, whether the tool predicts closer to the reservation or closer to the consumption.

We're promising whatever we can get now until the integration works between the two systems, which is in progress, and full configuration to highlight. I mean, Basim and the team will definitely work on it.\n\n Now, if it wasn't perfect, at least let's have the start Monday so that you'll start getting a feel, and we'll highlight that In X days, because we'll get more configuration, more dots connected and more data, you will see this again so that you'll have more and more comfort with the system rather than wait till everything is perfect from data and configuration.
