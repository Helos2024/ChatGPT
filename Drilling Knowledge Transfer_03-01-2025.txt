UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Everyone good morning. Good morning. Morning.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
More shall we try to call Kenan? Yeah, I'm messaging him.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Because I see he is away.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah. He sent an email.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
He sent an email yesterday, with some suggested videos.

Sheth, Kunal:
So I'll try to.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Are we also recording the session? Yeah, if recording is enabled.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Okay, I'm not copied in that email.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Ah, I thought he replied to everyone on them, but anyway, we can try to call on them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
you you I didn't get the reminder. To my laptop. Stay with me one minute.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sure.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
you Good morning, everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good morning.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Good morning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good morning.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Muhammad is here, so it must be high expectations, then, huh? Which one?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Both.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Naaman. And also Fakhuri, yeah.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Fakhuri, yeah.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
No, we're calling them both.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, both on leave. Both on leave, but attending, as you said, it's important.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Well, apologies for keeping you waiting. For some reason, these reminders don't pop up on the mobile anymore. So I need to find a switch. Okay, so I sent you... Mohamed, were you copied on the email last night? I don't recall you were on the email when I sent the links. Fakhoury... Not get those links.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Did everybody not see those links last night? I sent you some videos.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I got the email, but yeah, I got the email, but honestly, I didn't get a chance to see them. Yeah, it was in the email.

Madhavan, Tara:
You're right. I saw the first two videos, but I'm halfway through the third video.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
OK. Yeah, the third one was 20 minutes. So we have some experts on the call already. Um yeah so no but seriously I sent you a couple um just to just for those who are not familiar with the just the concept of drilling what happens um so I sent you those two um links initially of quick ones like maybe three five six minutes each but then the third one was like 20 minutes which is a good one that one was the um the shell version of a video probably probably 70s or 80s but it was a nice video uh that shows exactly how you know picture with a combination of videos on on site and and pictures uh so I thought that was useful uh probably I didn't send it to you in advance too too much but I thought you'd be you'd be up and keen and watching videos this morning so some of you haven't okay I'll take that into account account.

 Look, so if I understand the remit here, ADNOC is expecting you to at least be familiar with the drilling operations, and this is having an impact on their claim on their, you know, your understanding of what they want. So I'm going to attempt...

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, and some terminologies also that are specific to drilling that they get upset when we do not understand or we ask about yes so the operations and also some as you know specific words yeah exactly exactly so so I'm

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
going to try and um give you some some of the concepts uh to make sure that that um uh that you know you're familiar with it right so i've got three documents um I didn't try to measure them because I thought I thought it's better if you see them separately and One of them is like a training that I give a lot of the people that work with me on oil and gas, and it's more of an introduction to the whole oil and gas sector.

 So I thought that would be useful. Are you only experiencing issues with drilling? What about the rest of the upstream construction. Mohamed, is it only upstream? Oh sorry, is it only drilling? What about the rest of upstream? Mainly drilling, yeah. I mean the whole overview wouldn't hurt just for us to understand the bigger picture.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
All right, okay. All right, well let me just give you some of that as well.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
So I'm going to share my screen.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
But also as a terminology correction in terms of upstream, downstream. Upstream is the drilling part and downstream is all the industries that come after. Is that right? That's correct.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
That's a good segue to my first document then. Let me just give you some basics. I have no idea how much each of you know. Maybe some of you never worked in the oil and gas sector before. Let's assume so.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
This would make it easier on you not to basically eliminate so you can give everyone the same overview yeah so I'm happy to like I said I'm happy to uh you know to dodge into exactly what you want so

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
but you know it's just not a it's not a structured training course I'm trying to sort of see what your needs are and then and then maneuver accordingly so first first document I have is an overview sorry yeah go

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
ahead can I interrupt just a little bit can we record this session because I have one consultant on my team that is working a lot on drilling and sadly he couldn't be here today but if you can record so

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
he can check the video later. Could do, could do.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How do I do?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Do I have to do something? Actually the problem with KPMG's teams invites not everyone has authority to record so a task more because you're the owner can you try so definitely I tried I don't have I don't have the rights to to record we can

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
have another session if required I have no problem in recording so whoever can record go ahead uh but okay all right let's blow on so the first thing is let me give you an overview of upstream this is what I give over the years the last version here was I gave to KPMG in Qatar when I was heading advisory there because I noticed that the team needs to work with Qatar Petroleum and didn't know what upstream meant so um so I'm going to skip some of those slides because some of the exposing how, you know, my old days.

 So this was, this is just a typical view out of a balcony or out of a window offshore. So this is when my first day offshore. So I'll skip some of this stuff. You don't want to laugh at me being offshore.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
No worries, we'll remove this from the recording, Kenan.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
about 35 years ago that's how it looks. Okay so let's to answer your question Mohamed, upstream downstream okay so you have you have different activities uh in upstream and different activities in downstream that that leads to your um to your domestic if you like um energy use uh so that's one typical pictures many of these pictures around obviously is oil and gas um floating production storage offshore is a ship that, and by the way, some of these apply to deep water, some of these to shallow water, and then also you have the onshore, right, so the onshore here or the offshore you have downstream, obviously it's all onshore, and some of it apply to deep water, some of it to shallow water, so in, you know, I think Adnok is all shallow water.

 Shallow water is is 10 to 30 meters water depth. Whereas if you go to the North Sea, you may get 50, 100. Norwegian Trench is 300. If you go to Brazil, offshore Brazil, you can get up to 2,000 water depth. So that's one thing to be aware of So don't talk like if something is offshore, the water depth can be whatever, a mile. In the Gulf region, generally shallow water, some vessels can't even get in there, near the beach is 5-10 meters, you go out there most of it I think it's about 20-30 meters, so it's actually saturation, it's not really saturation diving, a lot of it is air diving, unless you spend a long time underwater for diving, for those of you who understand diving, so it's actually a shallow water.

 So FBSO tends to be in deep water, but these platforms that stand on legs can stand and rigs as well, jackup rigs, which I'll show you in a minute, can stand inside the water. These drilling guys, have they been talking about onshore or offshore? Both. They have both.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Both.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. All right.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
So I think most likely it's platforms like this, which have legs and they tend to stand in up to 30 meters, 40 meters of water, 30 probably, 30, 40 meters of water. So it's It's doable, so you get a jacket, which is the yellow part, and you've got the topside, which is the bit that sits on the jacket. So the yellow is jacket, the top is topside, and they just sit there. They're fixed. They're piled into the seabed ground, which I'll show you in a minute.

 Onshore, you can have drilling done just by a simple rig. You probably know cost-wise, you know, offshore it's two to four to five times more expensive across the field life cycle. I mean, for construction, if you're going to lay a pipeline offshore, it will cost you two, three, four times more than at least than onshore, because offshore there's no water, there's no ships, people can go home, where offshore people will just mobilise and live on the rigs for a long time.

 That's the drill rig. We'll dive into that in a minute. Then there's also unconventional oil and gas. They call it oil sand or shale. You've probably heard of that. So in the US recently, in the last sort of 10, 15 years, they started to get into shale. That's S-H-A-L-E, not S-H-E-L-L, like the company shale. This is shale, and there's shale oil. Yeah, Canada too, I think. Canada, there's US. Even got it in Jordan by the way.

 In Saudi Arabia, when I worked with Saudi Aramco about 10 years ago, that was like new unconventional gas. I did a few projects with them back then when I was in Accenture, because big parts of Saudi Arabia is shale as well. So they call that unconventional, right, as opposed to conventional. So this is like conventional stuff. If you see my cursor, and this is conventional, this is unconventional.

 So it's shale Okay and obviously when it comes on land downstream is all that stuff which I don't think you need to worry about too much here but you've got the petrochemical plants, you've got the refineries, you've got the gas to liquid plants, you've got the gas storage and LNG liquefied natural gas which tends to be so gas stored as a liquid basically and that's how it's exported from continent to continent and you've got the power stations that take some of that stuff as feedstock so they can run the power plant.

 Like in Kuwait, they have in Al Ahmadi in South Kuwait, they have all the oil and gas, they have all of this like stacked next to each other, if you like, the power plant, the LNG that they built recently and the refineries. So they tend to be situated, you know, where the pipeline comes from offshore. Okay. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that part of downstream. That's all retail and domestic gas and And obviously where you fill your cars.

 OK, any questions on this? OK, I'm not going to whatever you can share. You can share with us.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I mean, you can select some of them would be great. Just I think this one is a good something to keep on our back laptop background.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, thanks.

Sheth, Kunal:
I have just one question related to the downstream, so there is a midstream is also there in oil and gas, so how it is different than the downstream? Yes, sometimes they call this stuff, sometimes they call the grey area midstream, right, they call that the brown area midstream and this is downstream, sometimes they do that, but you know petro, refining petrochemicals sometimes called downstream, this area which I'm Yes.

 Okay. Because they say it's not upstream and it's not quite retail and downstream. Sometimes you get that. And remember, refineries has different stages. If you ever heard of refinery, in the column, you get everything from tar at the bottom, if you like, that goes on the roads all the way up to the top, which is the gas that you get in your petrol station. So sometimes it's done in stages as well.

 Okay. If somebody wants to make a note of which slide they want. So let's put slide four, I'll give you that. So upstream overview. So when you do the upstream operations, this is a typical end-to-end. You've got exploration, appraisal, development, production, and abandonment. So the exploration and Exploration is where you look at the field. I don't think you need to worry about on this project, but you actually do the 3D, even 4D, you know, the fourth dimension being time, and actually model the, you know, model the field after doing seismic surveys, all sorts of surveys.

 I'll show you some of that in a minute. So you appraise it, you get the approval, you develop the field, right? So you're going to start doing some drilling, initially do some test drilling and then you do some production drilling. So the videos I showed you show you some of the, see that picture there at the top, some picture at the bottom, it shows you what actually they do on site. We'll talk about some terms in a minute.

 Development, so once you get the, like this is it, we have oil, let's develop it. In the development stage, that's really the construction, you start, you start doing the, you know, building the field, putting the valves, installing the pipeline, the jack up I showed you earlier so you develop the fuel you set it all up and at the end of that you get what they call first oil first gas and then that's when production start and time wise this is this could take years this will take very quick appraise development typically takes two two years plus or minus half a year production could take 20 odd years 30 years a bit on the field life Some of the smaller fields have a shorter life, and obviously abandonment is quick.

 And abandonment, I'm not sure how much they focus on in the Gulf, but in the West it's pretty important so you don't leave something like that abandoned in the middle of nowhere. They have to dismantle it and recycle it, or you can't just pollute the world with assets that are full of hydrocarbons.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Okay, so that's the abandonment. Okay, all right, moving on. Just so you know, upstream is full of big stuff, right? It's just a lot of big stuff. I mean, when I first started, I was amazed how small I would look in front of some of this stuff. It's just big assets. Typical cost, you don't need to know that, but just so you know, there's all the cost of the different aspects of the field when they do it, so I'll skip that part.

 I'm not I'm not going to train you on everything today because you want to you want to know what if we have time we can go back exploration value drivers let's forget that the value tree like exploration okay exploration um not not a lot to tell you here because I don't think there's any MRO or it's a pick the IBP project but you know like I said earlier you you do a lot of surveys and calculations to size fields.

 Let me skip that. This is me in the Philippines by the way. There was a refinery that was going to be built and I said demolish all of this and put a refinery. That was quite sad. There's a lot of people living there at the time. Seismic survey. If that term is mentioned to you at all, this is where a ship can dangle like what they call a fish from back of their vessel or even sonar can be at the bottom of the vessel and it will just send echo sounders to the seabed and bounces back and you know the depth, you know the seabed formations, type of soil by just bouncing sonars basically, sand waves and what have you, to actually get a feel for the field.

 So that's what that's about again. I don't think that's featured in your in this project, but just so you know when I talk about seismic surveys and sizing and And sonars, etcetera. It's really just a way to size the field and understand the depth of each layer.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I think their main concern was for us. So the thing started with the term tie in, which I think you're aware of

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Not everyone was familiar.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so it's some of those terms and where they fit in the value chain This is what they're concerned about. So as you mentioned the exploration at the beginning or the appraisal, etc These are before they're concerned during development or the moment they start working that we know the full life cycle We know the terms in order to understand how we can optimize the stock or the material so on and so forth So their concern is if you do not know exactly exactly what we deal with, how can you optimize?

 You're just guessing or using another industry like retail, which doesn't apply.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
So that's the background anyway. They use the term tie-in in a drilling sense, or that's a development term? I think you're right.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I'll let the team answer, but it is during development. They say, okay, the moment that there is a juice flowing, if that's the right term.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Basically, when you create the world, basically, then after you connect it to the grid, the production grid they have, so that is the tie-in, basically.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Okay, so they're using it in that sense, because tie-in in the development phase is where you tie-in the rig to the pipeline.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, exactly that. And you connect it to the pipeline, I think.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Okay, well, that's not a problem. I've done many, many times. I can explain to you that concept in a minute. But tie-ins is development, really. So let's go back to drilling. So when you drill, you have the land lease, right? So that first bullet here is about the production sharing agreement set up between the developer and the landowner. So in, say, West Africa, Sun and Gold and Golden Oil Company, they will say this plot on the bottom of the seabed or even on land is a concession for a developer like BP or Shell or Adnok.

 And they will start doing the surveys and they start drilling and taking a drilling sort of test before they can actually confirm the well and then start drilling properly and do production. Okay, so evaluating a well is well logs, cause, production, testing. So well logs, what they do sometimes is they drill like a long, long, can you see the pictures? Sometimes they actually drill a long hole, if you like, and they take the sample out so they can actually see what soil is like, I even used to do that in development, not just drilling, because you want to know what the seabed is like or what the even onshore, what the ground is like, So you take samples, right?

 So there's well logs, there's production testing. If you watch the video I sent you, it's when you start drilling and take a sample out of the soil that you just drilled and take a sample out of the oil as well, because you don't just suddenly you're watching a movie suddenly you know you have like a liquid of oil sometimes you may have an interim area where the soil starts getting a bit oily and and you start seeing um you know you start seeing some oil now completion of I'm gonna rerun some of those terms later so don't worry but completing a well is is when you complete is when you finish the well ready for production So there's a lot of things about well completion.

 Slumber Jay, for example, has an IP on sand well completion. So when you complete wells in sand, you need to make sure that sand doesn't get into the pipe that goes up. So let me just show you here. I should park that thought. I'll come back to that, because this presentation is not structured just for drilling. So let me come back to that term. But I'm just going to show you some of the terms. Is the casing around that hole as you drill down.

 Liners is when you line it up. Tubing is the tubes that you put down the middle to start using for production. Tube pipes tend to be about 12 metres long and they put one after the other and start pushing it down the hole to make sure that the oil flows through it. Wellhead is the well head is the bit that sits you know as as you go out above the ground. Surface equipment is the equipment that sits on top like the Christmas tree which I'll show you in a minute.

 Sorry for the Christmas tree is the term used for that bundle of metal with a lot of valves on it that looks like a tree. They call it a Christmas tree and some of those riggers have a sense of humor in the old days but that's how it's stuck.

Madhavan, Tara:
It's called a Christmas tree. It looked like a fire hydrant in the Exactly, something like that, yeah.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
For example, yeah, those casings, liners, tubing.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
So logically, as part of what they're trying to optimize, so in drilling they have like 60,000 material, while in MRO they have 1.4 million. So logically, all of those are material they keep, either because they have a new well, or some of those could get replaced during the live lifetime of a weld, for example, the casing, they might get rusty or to be replaced or not. So I'm also trying to check what they would think or expect us to worry about replacing or having stock of

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Well, it depends on what stage of the operation. If you talk about pre-production, I think they need to be more agile because they don't know what to expect. So that's that video yesterday to get a feel for this because you may hit tough ground, you may need to change the drill bit every day, you may need to change the mud composition that you put down the hole. So let me come back again to that point when I have a picture in front of me so I can explain it.

 Just so you know, in terms of rigs, okay, depends on, as I said earlier, the water depth, the rigs get called different things. So if it's very, very shallow water, it's the barge, basically. It's not much more than a barge, which is almost touching the ground, leaving like one or two meters between the bottom of the ship and the ground. If you start getting a bit more comfortable, maybe about 10 meters, you can have this jacket with tender, but basically it's just a fixed rig where you're able to mount the drilling equipment.

 The jackup is the one that has the legs that go up and down, so you'll be able, I don't know if you've seen those, but when they, so they look like that, where I'm hovering my cursor here, when they finish, they will jack themselves down, put the legs up, and sail away, okay? Now, if you go to deeper water, which I don't think you're going to worry about in the Gulf region, Semi-sub is like, you see those pontoons that look like a U-shape?

 That's the picture of it up there. So all those are like floating tanks. If you fill them with water, you sink, and you become stable. If you want to sail away, then you empty them. Okay? Now, I've lived on some of those. It's quite fun. But they're huge. I mean, the difference between, just to give you a feel, between that top deck and the bottom deck, is a good, you know, 20 meters. So it's actually quite deep.

 And the reason why, when they fill them up with water and you go down, it's so the water waves does not kick around the rig, so the rig becomes stable, because most of the vessel is below the wave impact. And if you go to very deep, then you get fixed platforms where they have, these are wires that you anchor them and keep you stable. And if you really, in very deep water, like of South America, you have drill ships, which are much more expensive, dynamically positioned, and they try to stay in place.

 But here you're talking about, you know, very deep water. So this is probably the 30 to 100. This is probably the 100 to 200, probably 200 plus meters.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
So the first three are applicable for at least UAE or the region?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
I think they use probably more for the jackups.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which is, as you said, mobile.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
It's not like the fixed platform? It's mobile and it allows you to redeploy at different fields.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
But remember, in the exploration phase, you need one of those to start drilling. And if you have a dry well, which is a well where you don't find anything, you just plug it and move on, right? So that is probably the vessel they use to do the test drilling, establish the potential of the field, And you may find oil, but not much, right? So you start moving to one side and, you know, with the seismic survey results, you might say, okay, maybe one kilometer to the left is where the center of that field is.

 And again, and oh, wow. And I find like, this is where the bulk is. So you tend to spend the next 10, 20 years drilling in the center of the field, not at the edge of the field. And you gotta be careful, by the way, you can kill a field if you, suck the oil from the wrong angle, the wrong pressure, the wrong side. So that's what happened between Saudi and Kuwait and Khafji. They've actually killed the well.

 They actually, you know, they suck the oil from the wrong side, not maximizing the amount of oil they're gonna extract from it. And then you have the bulk of it still there, and then you run out of pressure and you can't get it out of the ground anymore. So they've actually killed the well. So it is a fine art, by the way. Right, so this is directional drilling. So directional drilling is when they start, you know, going in a certain direction.

 You can get horizontal, you can get tangent, you can get S-shape, but typically it's straight down like this one and it goes all the way down. The ground is different functions, so you don't know until you do a survey and start doing some drilling and see smart subsurface engineers start to draw the picture of what it looks like and what happened over the thousands of years ago. Okay so here just saying there's a reason why you would draw in different directions because of constraints or surface location you don't need to worry too much about that but I just wanted to show you this picture.

 Okay now breakdown of the drilling. Drilling is the most expensive part you can see why they're worried about it because it makes up especially offshore makes up some 72% roughly, last time I calculated that, of the whole operation. So even on shore, it's over half the cost. So you've got to make sure that when it comes to materials, you're not standing by, because you may say that's the cost of the ship.

 But if that ship doesn't get the materials that you give them, then it could stand by. And those vessels, by the way, those vessels very expensive, whether during development, which I'll show you in a minute, or during drilling, they're very expensive. Even in the old days, they're a good half a million pounds a day. Say now, they must be a good million dollars a day at least. Okay, so when you have a one or two million dollar a day vessel, and it's not just the vessel, it's the fleet, because those vessels, as you can see, have a supply boat that keeps back and forth, they have tow in vessels sometimes or they have the pilot vessels which transport people on and off unless they use the helicopter pad which is on each one.

 But it's a fleet and when those materials are late you can understand why these guys are a bit anxious. You can't have an expensive fleet like that standing by on a small item. That's why they stock all these items in your warehouse. You want to make sure that they're not standing by. Okay, so the casing is I think this is sorry.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I think this is about it. But team given the discussions. So, for example, if the drilling as Kenan mentioned, all of this material is very expensive. Sorry. It's basically needs to be available, so not to increase the cost of drilling. But at the same time, Kenan, if they have too much of it just to be on the safe side, we're back to square one because that's the objective of this project is to optimize on unneeded stock so maybe I let the team explain if they touched on this topic and because with Amaro we know the demand is basically the preventive the corrective etc so team for the drilling did they touch on this topic saying we need you to understand based on the nature of this project this is shallow not shallow I mean some how much of drilling material we need so that we're optimal.

 Again, whomever is on the call that was in those discussions, Hector, Kunal, Raoul and Tim. I'm just trying also to link this to, yeah, go ahead Hector. Look, I'm not saying we should pile stock.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
All I was saying is you can see why the behavior of the people on the ground resulted in a lot of stock. Because when they notice, you know, when I I'm the offshore operation installation manager. Oh, I am. They call them. And I'm doing this, right? I stay on the safe side. Let me add more stock.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I'm just saying to you, this is why they behave that way.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
And that's why you got a whole shit of stuff in the warehouse. And that's why now we need to optimize it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Which means to optimize, Kenan. Sorry to cut you off. To optimize, we need to know more about what drilling requires. And that's why I linked it. So preventive and corrective the team is reading the demand saying okay you have scheduled preventive maintenance but also you have those incidents in terms of corrective fine I think maybe not in this session later understanding how to optimize drilling not to put them at the risk of not having a stock but also this comfort zone where they keep piling up I think there's a lot of savings there but bear in mind but bear in mind Mohammed it's

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
an unpredictable operation yeah now but development is a lot more predictable. Drilling is more unpredictable. And like I said, if I was the offshore lead or the site lead, if you like, with the onshore offshore, and I see my cost components, and the smallest cost is the MRO or the parts. So I tend to be on the safe side. So I wasn't condoning what they do, but I'm just saying this is why they do it.

 Now, what makes them behave that way, I mean, when I used to order supplies offshore on the rigs, I used to order more because I just ordered one last month and it didn't arrive. OK, so when I see the long lead items, when I get burnt by lack of materials, the next time I order, I order more because the supply was unreliable. But if you show them a system that allows them to order quickly get this in a reliable and it's not just system by the way you guys must realize if you don't have the right contracts behind those systems yes you can have the best system but then the supplier has a shitty sorry it's his language a bad contract and he you know would even with the best system he's he's going to deliver late because the time yeah lead time to manufacture or to deliver and all of this transport yeah so all of this we need to tell ADNOC at some point Mohammed maybe you and I and whoever tell them that the other opportunity to improve on is procurement in AdNoc, which I understand is not in a good state.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I can't see hands or people by the way because I've got my screen on the screen. Probably it's the same that Rahul is going to say, but in this case what we know is that AdNoc is sort of about BMI. For drilling so they tend to give this agreement with the vendors and they keep like one year of stock and that is non-negotiable so basically we are not optimizing the stock levels with the drilling materials we are just keeping that rule that for every material we will need to have one year of stock and that is the requirement.



Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Okay even VMI's can be optimized because I don't know what the SLAs are for VMI's but is this vendor managed inventory guarantees the material within how many days and stuff like that. But we're not going to get into that. We're just discussing the ecosystem here. There is a certain dynamics on site where you can see the cost elements. I mean, the casing and completion and drilling all require, I mean, evaluation is probably just mostly an office cost and preparation is probably the mobilizing which is very expensive, by the way, to mobilize and demobilize offshore.

 But drilling, casing, and completion are probably the majority of the work, and they all require materials.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Rahul, you wanted to say something?

Patel, Rahul1:
Yeah, so as per our current discussion with ATLOG, there are two pieces of what we are trying to do. One is the material requirement planning for all the phases of wells. So right from drilling to to completion, all the phases of the well preparation, they want us to plan the material. And then when it comes to procurement, they have 95% of the material through the vendor-managed inventory, what Hector has mentioned.

 And what we are trying to do is forecast the material based upon the drilling requirement, and then to be able to give the visibility based upon the procurement plans with the VMI, how the inventory is getting fulfilled with the appropriate lead times to give them end-to-end visibility across the planning cycle.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Patel, Rahul1:
MROs are not part of drilling, because MRO is a separate business for them, which means that when we say drilling, it's not MRO. It's only the materials required for drilling the well, completing the well, and then tying the well. The development.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, the development and completion phase of the And then once the well is into production, they have a different a group company which is called AdNoc Drilling, which is only responsible for managing the production of the drilling wells. Our system that we're installing, sorry, the objective then, what they see getting out of this project is an improvement in terms of digitizing all the materials that we get and optimizing the process from order to receipt of the materials.

 Exactly, so to be able to forecast all the materials required for all the drilling wells which are in plant, so they have a planning system, we integrate with that planning system and we create a material requirement plan for entire AdNov and give them end-to-end visibility for supplying those materials for the drilling as per the plan of the well. But optimizing the number of widgets by code if you like, by by item the number you know the number the quantities per item that's that's nothing to do with us on this project right yes so they will provide us the input as in how many quantity material required per well so we are putting up a process to define a drilling bomb which allows us to essentially identify the material required during the different phases of the drilling so that we can forecast those materials and then once we have the demand for per well for those materials then we we have the supply plan which gives them visibility of available inventory at different location, how we can optimize the existing stock without going out to vendor to procure.

 And then if we are going out to vendor to procure, then what are the lead times, different lead times, and giving them the visibility how and when the metal is available. Yeah, but we are not calculating, if you like, that you need five of those, six of those, 100 of those, right, per well, per drill. We're not quantifying stuff. We're digitizing the process basically. So the quantification we expect is part of the drilling bomb, where they will tell us that for each type of well, so they have gas producer, oil producer well, so different types of well they have and for each type of well, what is the material requirement would be an input to our system in form of bill of material.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
From them?

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, from them.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
So you guys, you guys don't expect to to quantify materials. Correct, right? That's not. So if I understood well, the variable part that you were referring to before, and that could be very.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I mean, there's a major gap in it or Delta. It could be high. It could be low in terms of what's required. Raoul and the team are confirming we get this bomb, but we need to help them plan afterwards. So we're not. As you said, we're not responsible to figure out because this well is of type X or Y or as you said as you work sometimes you realize it's you need different material or more of a certain item.

 This part is their responsibility but they want us to manage or optimize afterwards. Right team that's a correct replay?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah that's okay good. So when I'm talking to you and giving you examples of plants and ordering and they're using some terms that you guys are then kind of stuck, like what part of drilling are they referring to? This is the issue that's happening.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right, okay.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Any other comments before I continue? Okay. All right, so guys, in front of you is a drill string. You've got the swivel, the kelly, the drill pipe, stabilizer bit. So that's the important part, which is made of various very, very tough metal. When you go to conferences, you know, like exhibitions where the drillers are, you know, have a booth and they will have sawdust drill bits. If you get an opportunity, go to one of them and see what it looks like, I didn't try to put one of those in my bag, but I tried something much, much smaller, which is a nozzle for a jetting, you know, like a small part of this part, if you like, and I put it in my bag, in those days to take it from Holland back to the UK and then I got stopped in the airport.

 They thought I had a bomb in my bag or something. So these are these are like very heavy steel, tough metal.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah also anyone from Middle Eastern background yeah that's not recommended.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
No back then I said what is this and I had to explain to the immigration guys that this is just... What is it? Give them a crash course on upstream so they can believe I'm it was just a piece of metal I mean it was nothing there uh all right uh blowout prevention so this picture is useful so you can see see some of the terms there um I'll let you read some of the terms there but but you know so this is this is part of the the explanation on blowout prevention as some of you saw the video yesterday so suddenly if you get into different formation different pressures there could be a blowout so what do is they control it, and they control the back pressure, they close the back flow.

 So blowout prevention could be used as a term in your conversations. So basically it's a simple grandmother-like language. It's in case whatever you're drilling into of blows in your face and you need to you need to control it. I mean these things cost millions, these Christmas trees or blowout prevention they're not just a simple plumbing plumbing kit you know they're actually quite big expensive materials that can withstand different pressures and temperatures.

 This is one thing you need to appreciate when you go underground suddenly you may get into very high pressures which helps us to get it all out of the ground but it can also blow in your face and and there's something called h2s which is uh hydro hydrogen sulfide so I guess it's been a while since i've done my chemistry uh but h2s is something that you may start smelling for the first few seconds and then you die so um so it's something which is serious so if you're drilling and there's h2s alert like I had one night and 3 a.m.

 In the morning and then everybody sounds and you need to put your mask on and go to the top so a lot of bad stuff comes out the ground the other thing to bear in mind is underground not just high pressure but high temperature so some of the stuff comes out very hot and you're going to be able to have the right materials to to handle that all right okay so that's the now somebody useful term so that part is the that part it's a simplistic sort of a picture here so look look at the let's look at the left first because that's how so so there is uh can you see those where my cursor is so and again that's why I sent you the video because you have to to see something visual like a playing you see those casings here so you start you know you build those in and you cement them in and you put the next layer cemented in and that's how that's how you start drilling deep and ensure that the thing doesn't collapse.

 So production casing, cement is put in, the BOP that I just described, the blowout prevention valves, it's the bit that sits on top. Now once you want to complete the well, you have to put a pipe where you want the oil to go up in. So SSSV, that's the the emergency shutdown valve in the old days before the 80s they didn't used to have them and the Piper Alpha incident happened because we didn't have the the emergency shutdown valve so basically if the oil starts blowing up coming up and somebody likes a match then the whole oil field will be on fire and it becomes like a big big gas cooker for for many for many months until all the oil burns out so that that valve allows you to shut it down right and that crystal is the bit that sits above the ground, this is where the ground is here, so the bit that sits above the ground whether it's underwater or onshore and that has many valves.



Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
And is tie-in part of this process if I understood the term properly before?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Right, I mean the term tie-in can be like I said used in different things, basically what tie-in means is you have two pipes that tie in together with a flange or some kind of tie-in mechanism. So tie-in on the seabed is when you have a pipeline tie-in to a spool pipe that ties into the riser, and the riser ties into the big truck. So the word tie-in basically can be used for anything. I bet you when they put a Christmas tree and tie-in to the production tubing, they call that a tie-in, right?

 So So be careful, the word tie-in could be any part of the system. So take it with a pinch of salt. Don't assume tie-in only one situation in one part of the system. I mean, tie-in is a tie-in, right? But here's some of the, so you have a choke, you have a flowline valve, and then here's where the pipeline tie-in here to the, pipeline that runs to the refinery, if you like, hundreds of kilometres away.

 Okay, that's a Christmas tree, that's shut down valve, production tubing, production packers to make sure the oil doesn't flow in here. This thing is not completely to scale, as you can imagine, but you see some of the terms. Now, this is where the reservoir is, where that grey area so as you see probably from the video when at one point they put a they put a tube down and they send like bullet bullets that penetrates the casing that you just installed and goes inside the the reservoir and then the oil can actually flow out of those perforations in here the flood displays and they go up the tube and all up all the way oops all up all the way up right if that's open the oil goes up, there's some Christmas tree that allows to manage the pressure and the flow, and it goes into a choke and goes into the pipeline.

 Okay, so these are the, you know, so cement is very important as a material. Mud, when you do the drilling, this is completing, this is after drilling, but when you do the drilling, as you drill, as you use this part here, you have to push mud so they can take the crap back up again to the surface. So when this is, you can see here mud jets. So when you're drilling, you're pushing mud in to, if any of you are mechanical engineers, I mean, whenever you drill, there's heat generated and there's debris.

 So you have to remove, you have to get a fluid, a fluid that removes the heat and debris out of the drilling area.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's true. Mud.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
OK. That's true.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Mud.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I have a question.

Madhavan, Tara:
I saw that sometimes, when you're drilling at the topmost place, you use seawater. And then later on, as the depth increases, you use mud. Do you think for shallow drilling, it is seawater, or it's always mud?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Well, obviously, I'm sure there isn't seawater. As far as I know, they use majority, it's mud. But the mud is, I mean, they call it mud, but they add, and I think you see in one of the videos, they add some kind of ingredients, some kind of chemicals to it to keep it fluid. Because if the mud gets too thick, it will not flow, and you can actually easily get stuck. So the mud could be anything. Could be I don't know 90% water if all I know right okay depends on depending on where you're drilling and how shallow you are so so think of it as a fluid that that required during drilling call it mud but it could be anything okay okay a question from my side there's an art there's an art to that by the way you know what composition what chemical what pressure what temperature to what flow rate to make sure that you drill in an optimized way without breaking the drill bit without breaking the pipe especially if you're like drilling at the tip of the drill is 300 meters away from you could imagine it's the drill pipes by the way is only it's only um remember how many inches but it's only like a six eight inch drip pipe right so inch for some of you so it's it's like 15 centimeters okay so imagine 50 centimeters, 300 long, how much can you control that pipe when you swivel, when you turn it?

 You can easily break the pipe. If you break it, you have to go fish it out and stick another piece on there and drill again if you hit rock or you hit some hard layer in the ground.

Patel, Rahul1:
Sorry, who else was asking a question? Yeah, this is Rahul. So two questions. One is BOP and Christmas tree are the same terms? Because we've heard Christmas tree a lot in the conversation.

Madhavan, Tara:
No, no, no. The blowout prevention valve is separate from Christmas tree. Now, Christmas tree could have a BOP inside it, but it's not the same term. Now, Christmas tree is the huge, it's like two, three meter big, I think one of you described it like a big, what did you describe it?

Patel, Rahul1:
It's a combination of different things on it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
When you go to these shows, you'll find that the producers of Christmas trees, they'll have one on their booth. Go to the next show, Adepec must have had some of those on there when Adepec happened last month or two months ago. You'll see some samples, and they're very proud of them. It's a bit like cars. This is my Model X, XYZ, whatever, Christmas tree.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, they brag about the latest and greatest.

Patel, Rahul1:
Yeah, it's a bit like their Ferraris. OK, so that's the drilling and the completion. Very quickly but I would encourage you to watch those videos because you can see then the mechanics of them and you can see how how you know the sequence of events and how the mud flows and how the cement decides but those are the terms that they will use okay now any other guys there are other terms that you'd like to explain yeah yeah good I'm gonna say before you ask question as you said there's thousands of materials to go with this right uh so so you know it's a lot it's a very long list of terms if you have any terms I could try and explain them if I know them because but sometimes you may I may even even myself find terms that I don't know because they're very specific or americanized versus British or whatever.

 So it just becomes a language thing. But the whole thing is that you know it comes in like priority or terms. So if somebody says like Christmas tree, it's very obvious. So if you don't know that, they say, well, he's completely from a different sector. But if it's something like a flange, a gasket, terms like that, bidirectional or whatever. I mean you may start getting to the next level and then there may be some very specific pieces that only drillers understand like roughnecks understand.

 So I'm just saying there's different layers but go ahead test me see if I can pass the test. So the major category of metals I have put in the chat where this is what we are working upon. So if you can quickly open the chat these are the major category of metals we are applying So, if you can help us relate this category of material in the drilling process and at what stage which materials are used, then that probably will give us a good perspective from a planning which material gets planned first from a well perspective.

 These are the categories of material which ADNOC has provided us, which are in scope for our planning. Okay, that's fine. Look, I've covered some of these. I've covered most of these already. So, starting from the bottom, drill bits are the bits I showed you. Those bits with the rough things, yeah? When it comes to cementing accessories, so, you know, that's all the, you know, cementing is, so when you drill down the hole and you go with the casing, you need to cement around it, right?

 So you push cement down the middle, and that cement then goes up the sides and makes a wall around the, the casing and it goes all the way up to the top and you leave it for a while and it solidifies as you probably saw in the video. So, I mean, liner hanger, this is the, I showed you that a minute ago, right? So that's that bit basically. The liner hanger. So it's actually, so it's all about lining, right?

 And you go from big size to small size. So that's that part. So liner is in the oil and gas sector, normally liners is, you have like something tubular, circular, and you line it, right? So you can have liners on the inside. I mean, when we install a pipeline on a seabed, you can have a liner on the inside, you can have liners on the outside the outside could be concrete coating the inside could be anti-corrosion sleeve or anti-corrosion coating so that's is the term normally normally refers to that.

 Downhole completion I just showed you right so downhole completion so it's downhole right and it's completion so you complete the well by putting this this So you have oil flowing in up the tube, you pack it, you make sure the oil doesn't go in the wrong place. Now, like I said, there's some types of well-completion. So sand area, which I'm sure ADNOC has a lot of, there's a different technology, different intellectual property that slumbers on Halliburton's and and Baker Hughes, et cetera, used to actually make sure, because what you don't want is the sand to get into the oil, right?

 So, completion is making sure that you clean basically the setup here so the oil flows in without much sand or debris. So, it's how you cement it, how you stick that tube in there, you pack around it, you proliferate the oil field, the oil, the reservoir, and make sure the oil. So that's completion. With drilling, all you're doing is drilling down and to get to the reservoir to get some samples. And obviously you cement as you do that, because you don't want it to collapse on you.

 But that's still, you know, rough drilling and exploration, if you like, For completion, this is between finishing the drilling and making sure the field is ready to produce. Okay. So it's different stages. Downhole completion we talked about. Wellhead, obviously it's a wellhead. We talked about that. This is the tubular goods. So the casing, the tubing, the piping, the pipelines is all OCTG. So it tends to be the term they use for the oil industry.

 So it's all contra-tubular goods. So it's everything tubular basically for the old sector. And that tends to be the big part. I'm sure OCTG is the big part of your materials, right? That they're giving you? Yeah. And the bone? Yeah. Yes, correct.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I think that's in the Excel that we received also.

Patel, Rahul1:
Yeah, so we have received the OCTG cell right now so more money from the planning process whatever materials we have received are from OCTG category and rest of the material categories we have not received yet but that's a separate conversation. And OCTG tends to be the high pressure stuff where if somebody calls pipe and line pipe that tends to be the lower pressure stuff. Now lower pressure um typically you know below 100 bars uh I mean if you use pound per square inch psi the uh the the normal this is like a thousand psi the occt tends to be in the several thousand psi maybe ten thousand twenty thousand psi uh type of equipment so just watch out the pressure variations I'm sure all these items that you mentioned the the there's two dimensions here that you know there's to each item there's the pressure and there's the material um and they tend to be maybe related so when you buy OCTG or even line pipe let's take line pipe for example I mean I bought millions of this stuff you can have x60 x65 you can have duplex you can have uh you know the car you know the basically the the metal carbon the alloy composition of that material so you have a lot of variations okay and some that can work under high pressure and some on low pressure and the thickness of all of these OCTGs matter if you know you may have 15 mil wall 10 mil wall 5 mil wall whatever so all of that goes so just be be conscious of that it's not just standard fittings if you like, it just depends.

 And some of the fields developed recently, they call it high pressure high temperature fields, where they have to put thick stainless steel or thick duplex metal, whether OCTG probably or lime pipe, to make sure that the hydrocarbons, which are high pressure high temperature, can actually flow this through without corrosion and without blowing up.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Is this helping, guys?

Patel, Rahul1:
Yeah, yeah, this is really helping, yeah. All right, we'll go back.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
And if I may suggest, team, I think, Kinan, I listed the slides that at least I saw that would be relevant or important to us. So we can go through them and also check our nodes from the meetings, the Excel, et cetera. So team, let's do this. Maybe we can come back to Kenan with some specific questions saying, okay, we understood this. We linked this to the information we had, but however, we still have the following terms or concepts that are not clear.

 This way it's more targeted after this overview. Again, if you have other suggestion, go ahead, but that would help us.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Okay. So I'll track a little bit so you can actually see more of what you need and then you have the opportunity to ask questions. I'll skip through this, this is just showing you know as you'd imagine like any project there's the CAPEX cost and there's the OPEX cost. So just bear that in mind, it takes a while. Exploration, appraisal, development, production and then the cost you know there's a...



Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
The investment is upfront, yeah, upfront investment.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
It gets you the money and it pays for itself after that. Okay, and the risk is the highest at the beginning, but this is just the background information. A few facts about the product, I don't think you need to know this. Petroleum is a Greek derivation, petrol and oleum. So I was teaching this, so I put this slide, but I'm just looking here, is there anything that benefits you? Obviously you have American right API so you may see that as part of materials specification but there's you know API is a term used there is the sulfur content so you may find materials that are made for sweet or sour that's that's really sweet sour when they set you sweet sour or they're not talking about your Chinese meal here yeah exactly the sulfur content okay light oil is more applicable to us versus heavy oil okay exactly and and uh I don't think you need to know about the types of oils but you know there's light and heavy and and there's wti and and you know the american so so they have different gravities different sulfurs so when you talk about materials I'm just relating it to maybe anything relevant to you just bear that in mind when then suddenly they say to you no this item there's like six types depending on the the heavy oil you know the heaviness of the oil uh or temperature or whatever so just bear in mind it's not just it's you know it's not like olive table olive oil that's all all the same there's there's different types of oils different temperatures different corrosion different sulfur content okay bear that in mind uh so during development which is the bit I like most actually because uh that's more interesting so when you develop a field let me just show you some of this stuff yeah so when you develop a field you have feasibility design detail design procurement construction commissioning and project post project review so there's increasing cost there oops what happened let's go back sorry yeah so so whatever they do they have to design it they have to procure it and procuring could include by the way, coating it and shipping it to the site.

 Then the construction is a big area with heavy vessels. The vessels I've shown you so far are for, I showed you survey vessels, I showed you drilling vessels, and well completion vessels, and it could be production rigs, etc. But between production, as you remember, I showed you earlier, between production appraisal or drilling, if you like, and production. The development includes also the construction of all the assets.

 I mean, you need to put permanent, you know, everything from Christmas tree or to the refinery that needs to be developed as well. And I'm not sure if they're talking to you about that. But once you've done these production facilities, whether there are jackup like here, that steel jackup is what probably Adnok has, like I said earlier, mostly in the Gulf region. This tends to be the in the Norwegian kind of sector type of places and these are like even deeper and this is the FPSO that I showed you earlier it can produce but it's anchored.

 Now a word riser right you may need to know a riser is basically just the pipeline which could be a flexible or could be a rigid a pipeline that goes from the well to the ship or to the rig so you can have a solid riser down the leg here, which I've installed a lot of It's a solid riser, right? So it could be a 6-inch, a 10-inch, a 12-inch pipe, basically, that bolts onto the leg of the platform, and the oil comes out of the ground.

 It goes up that production line. It gets processed. It gets whatever done to it, lower the pressure to it, you know, maybe add something to it, and then it goes down as a riser, as they call it, and then there's a tie-in here that connects to the pipeline. Okay? Similar with very deep water, there's a flexible riser here in the middle, so all these wells, each one will have a riser between the Christmas tree and the vessel, right?

 In this case, it doesn't go down a riser to a pipeline. It goes because it's deep water. It goes to a shuttle tanker and it goes somewhere else. So they use a shuttle tanker instead of a solid pipe that goes between the well and the beach, or between the well and the refinery onshore.

Patel, Rahul:
Okay, does that make sense? So... So riser is something which pulls out oil? No, riser is basically just a tubular, it's a pipe. That connects the well to the production asset. So you can have a riser, even this could be called a riser, because really it's just a pipe that goes, but this is the production, like the oil line that comes up. But the riser tends to be, yeah, I mean, it could be up or down.

 Oil goes up, something. You never have a pipe we very rarely have a pipe connecting a Christmas tree on top of the well straight to the refinery. It tends to go to a place like this, top of the platform, to get processed, or to an FBSO, and then transported via tanker, if it's deep water, or via a pipeline if it's on land, to the refinery. This is more like tying what they've explained to us that once the production starts, the piping which connects the weld to the production facility is what they call tying.



Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah. So here on the next slide, I'll show you. I don't know why I'm getting... Let me just... I don't know why I'm getting this bit at the bottom. How do you get it out? Hang on. Oh, here we go. No?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, it worked before, yeah, when you click on it, it disappears.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Because otherwise you can't see the page number. So here, so this is probably a typical setup, okay? So you've got the host production platform, which is a jackup, sorry, not jackup, a platform in relatively shallow water. Like I said earlier, probably 30 up to 50 maybe meters, which is suitable for the Gulf region. You have that riser that brings oil up. But then what you'd have is a riser coming down and there's a flow line here, the export line.

 Can you see that? So that tying that up here, you tie up. You can imagine the pipeline is installed up to the platform and then there's a tie-in spool that connects. So imagine if you have two points, a bit like a railway track. You have You put a pipe between those two points, and that pipe goes from A to B. But at each end of that pipe, you cannot have a very rigid connection that stops the expansion of the pipe, because that pipe is probably 100 to 200 kilometers between the well and where you're taking it, the refinery on the beach, et cetera.

 So what we used to do is tie in spool. So spool is like a Z shape or an L shape, like that. Like this is an L shape, but you can have a Z shape as well if it flips the other way. And that allows movement, expansion of the pipe. Otherwise, if you put it straight onto the platform, straight into the refinery, it would expand. What's gonna happen? It's gonna push the platform, it's gonna push the refinery.

 Yeah, so they put a spool in that, and I've always used, for that operation. It's actually how you tighten, but like I said, it's probably used also for these smaller ones, but these smaller ones don't have it, don't have, this is on the field here. So these smaller ones don't have much of an expansion. It's the export line that will have it or a longer flow line. But you know, so you can have this set up below on the seabed because you don't want to put 10 platforms, right?

 You put one and you have a subsea manifold with satellite wells. I'll show you what one of those look like, because I was standing next to one and took a picture of it. But these are, you know, you can have the wells here, you know, all tying up to a manifold, and then just these are short distances, yeah? These are just around the field within 50 metres, 100 metres, 200 metres, coming platform.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Kenan and team I have a suggestion because Raoul and team you mentioned that we were waiting on the details of the bomb. I think once we need to have that discussion with them maybe Kenan will align with you you can join us this way if we're asking for more details or we're trying to understand what the bomb details are at least you would be able to ask in a more in a smarter way saying is this what you mean etc because they'll understand that you know the industry you're just trying to confirm the elements while in our case it would

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
be a bit more of a wild guess.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
That's what I tried to do when I attended a couple of times when Mo invited me.

Patel, Rahul:
Exactly, now they'll get into the details. I know that's again them expecting. So Mo, actually we are ready at this point to send back the questions to AdNoc team. So yesterday only, we had a call between GoSCM and ARD, and we have the list of open questions based upon our understanding of data. I was waiting for this session to happen so that when we ask the questions back, we ask in a relevant term so that it does not sound like we don't know about Relink.

 So probably, Kinan, once I'll draft the email, I'll send that email to you so that if you can cross-check if we are using right terms when we are asking, more data from them with respect to the data they've shared with us.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
I think it's a matter of taking the bomb and the terms as they are, but we just need to make sure that you have an idea of what these things mean in what context and what industry, because otherwise you may be taking an apple.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, this is where you can help us.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
In a meatloaf, like you don't put apples in meat, right? It's that kind of stuff. I think we have this kind of situation. So let me plow through I'll skip through these. These are different operations. During construction, when you put the pipe on the seabed, you have to flatten the seabed. I did my master's in this, how to dredge and flatten the seabed back in 1990. When you lay the pipeline between A and B, like I said to you, this is the long pipe that expands, right?

 When you lay it, you have a vessel that lays the pipe. I know that it looks like an umbilical more than a pipe, but even an inch thick steel pipe, which is only say half a meter in diameter or even a meter in diameter, if you have a very long length of it, it will bend. Okay, so here they put 12 foot joints in, you know, weld them one after the other and then they push them off the side and it's like, this is called a sleigh, okay this is this is j-lay but basically it's the same thing that you put another pipe the same concept as drilling the drilling you you screw it on because you don't have time to weld it on oil on drill rigs so you screw a joint on a on a joint and you push it down the hole so you can get to the reservoir when you lay a pipe on a seabed which is really just transporting the oil from the Christmas tree to the refinery if you like this one you you weld it you weld it on because you have to put on a seabed put concrete coating, make it more stable, and it's bigger normally, and you're going to be worried about the wave effect.

 The fishermen, by the way, sometimes drag their anchors and pull your pipe, so you weld it. So what you do is put another joint, the welder, and put it on the seabed. I'm not sure if construction is part of the bomb that you'll get, but this has different type of materials for pipeline. A trenching is once you've got it on a seabed you trench it, somebody says trenching, so basically the pipeline is picked up, this is a jetting type of trenching but you get ploughing, so jetting is where you fluidize under it and let it sink in the ground and then you cover it up, so make sure then if somebody drags an anchor or drags the fishing net or whatever it doesn't get tangled with the pipeline, especially in shallow water like the gulf, I think you have to trench the pipeline, put it under the seabed.

 This is an illustration of that trenching. I'm sure you don't need to know too much about that. This is a tie-in. As you can see, it's a spool piece, like a Z piece. This is, by the way, me taking the picture when I was installing it. This tie-in piece here, you can see the one end. They have a line-up clamp. That's what's called a line-up clamp. There's a similar end on the platform but to get the flange right so there's a flange here I don't know if you can see it the flange is really uh you know you have a pipe and then you have a wider lip with bolts around it you've probably seen it uh fire hydrants as somebody said so so you you line up the the flanges and you bolt it so for that operation you need lineup clamps you need bolts you need nuts you need gasket the gasket is the bit that sits here let me just see if I can zoom in so you'll have you'll have a this is the the edge of the flange and these flange would be ANSI standard A-N-S-I you'll see them in the BOM typically ANSI standard is the American standard so I'm just giving you a flavor for this so the flanges would be again different sizes different pressure ratings and and the help you tie two pipelines up together.

 And then you put a gasket around the edges here, which is metal, by the way, but soft metal. So when you close the two flanges up and you bolt them, the gasket in the middle, I don't know if any of you do any plumbing at home, it's a similar concept, that gasket in the middle becomes squashed and will ensure nothing leaks. So it's a bit like, it's not rubber, it's actually steel, but it acts, you know, it feels like it's a rubber seal.

 So you've got a flange, the gasket, the bolts, the nuts. So these are typical things that you find on every bomb, I'm sure, if you do field development. And you get those not just on the tie-ins, you get those also on the platform because you may have temporary joints and tie-ins, or smaller size, on the rigs as well these are and obviously you have elbows you can imagine you know what the elbow is this is an elbow piece so this is if you see it there can you see it there is that too small you have you have a flange with a lineup clamp you have an elbow piece which is 45 degree then you have a bit of straight pipe another 45 degrees another bit of straight pipe welded to the next one epoxy coated so when you look at the bomb you'll see all of these terms being used.

 You wonder what they are, but this is to create that.

Patel, Rahul:
Maybe at the end of the presentation, we can show you the bomb we have received. Maybe a quick glance. Sure, sure. Don't want to get too much into the seabed sort of pipeline because you may not have any of that, but you've got something called concrete mattress, right? There is something called concrete I know it sounds funny, but it's actually concrete blocks which are all tied up in ropes, and they put it on top of the pipe to keep it stable.

 So if somebody says concrete mattress, don't laugh. And you get rock dumping where they dump rock on top of pipe. I mean, I can talk forever about this. But just so you know, the trench, they put the pipe in there, they put rock on top, or they put concrete mattresses. I don't know if you're going to get into any of that. Offshore evacuation system, we'll skip that. They're just showing you the SPAR and an SBM, single buoy mooring.

 Offshore Singapore is a huge one of those. You have a very heavy, big, ultra tanker that comes twice a day and takes oil out of it. Because sometimes you cannot put more than an SBM in a busy strait, like strait of Singapore. The pipeline, and you see that bend? What do you think that bend is for? That's instead of a spool, so if that pipeline expands, there's a bit of a spring effect here to expand the pipe without pushing the SPM.

 The oil comes, goes up, I know I'm going very fast, but hopefully you're staying with me, and the oil comes up to this buoyancy area, and when a tanker comes twice a day, they stop the shipping in Singapore and then they load it and then off it goes again. So just so you know, so these are called SPAR type storage terminals. These are different, this is Deepwater, so I'll skip that. You don't have any of that in the GCC.

 This is what a rig looks like, semi-submersible. Uh now I this is my car so you see how big how big these things are right they're huge uh this is the one I lived on for a while uh this is this is me down there see how big these things are this is a this is a heavy lift vessel this this is seven thousand uh two two times seven thousand ton cranes it can lift the whole platform in one lift fourteen thousand lift but you can see how big these things are you can see the pipe the pipe gets rusted it quickly but don't worry it's uh it's fine because when you install it you put some cathodic protection so it doesn't erode but these are like size of size of things right you see the 20 foot container it looks very small but you see it on the on the road it looks big okay uh this is in netherlands and rotterdam uh production um two two minute production I'm not you need any of this.

 This is just more about the process as opposed to materials. Yes, I've added this. Again, more terms. You've got drill pipe, platform, cable, traveling, Kelly, rotary, engines. I think we've covered a lot of this. We've got slash pump, mud ditch, mud suction pit, vibration You may come across some of these terms. Steel casing cemented in place. We talked about all of this already. You talked about a lot of mud chemicals in the planning.

 The chemicals, they say, as part of the planning. Mud chemicals is what they think about.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, so all that mud sort of equipment is to ensure the mud actually goes down while you're drilling and make sure that temperature is maintained, the debris, and that mud is analyzed when it goes back up so they can see what's inside, what they're drilling into. Christmas tree allow pressure to reduce at the level surface facilities can handle, I mentioned that. Let me just see what else, so well designed.

 I think those slides are also good for us as a reference. Yeah, I'll give you those too, but it's more of the same. I think a couple of abandonment you don't need to know but things get abandoned in a safe way hopefully but here it may give you an idea of you see when you when you when they sometimes they they plug it so basically they just put cement plug right when they abandon it so so the oil used to flow through here it goes up right so now you know the the new cement that they is just to plug it here and here to make sure nothing escapes in future years.

 So they have to be responsible and, as they call it, plug the well. And sometimes when they're drilling and there's nothing there, they don't obviously develop it like this. But same concept, they plug it to make sure if there's a dry hole or there's not enough oil coming out of it, they plug it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
And what do they do, Kinan, to repair the oil they remove so you don't have void or just empty structure underneath.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
No, it just fills up with water. Yeah, water.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
But onshore then you need to do this yourself because there's no water to do it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'm more of an offshore guy than an onshore guy. I think onshore, but look, you know, Mother Nature, I mean, you're talking about a long a long distance below, and it tends to be below a hard, hard layer of rock. So nothing's going to collapse, you don't have to worry about that. I mean, it's like, and full of layers of rock and whatever, nothing's going to collapse. Sure. But you know, but, you know, what sucks back into it, they're probably still discovering, you know, what happens there.

 But remember, when it's a pressurized area, right? Because oil is trapped at high pressure, and gas as well. So there are whole, not all fluid in the first place, there's a lot of gas pockets. And when the pressure depletes or goes down, then it stops flowing up and you leave some of it behind, you don't suck up every part of it. But you have good imagination, it's good. Let me just, I don't wanna, so yeah but you have to go offshore in one of those suits to go offshore this is how it looks like offshore just standing there in the middle of nowhere so every morning you have you have this kind of view when you wake up uh but that's see see that's the jacket right that's the jacket there this is unmanned platform some of them are manned some of them are unmanned uh so you may hear that term top side is this part so they say this is a valve for the top side okay top side jacket That's the production thing going up there.

 The riser, can you see the end of the riser here? So that riser goes up like that. There's a pig trap, pig as in pig, P-I-G. They use the term pig a lot here. So when you send something through the pipeline, maybe I should tell you that as well, they use the term pig, right? So they say this is for the pig, This is an intelligent pig. Intelligent pig is basically a plug that you send through the pipeline that has instruments on it that measures wall thickness and any variation in the diameter of the pipe.

 So there's terms pig and smart pig, intelligent pig. There's a big pig trap on top here because when you send it from end to end, you trap it. You put pressure behind it like fluid or hydrocarbons and it comes out on the other side and it would have a plate, a very soft metal plate that will see if there's any damage to the pipe. So that's another term for you. This is this jacket in the yard before you stood on the seabed.

 So these are cathodes. So cathodic protection, which is made up of zinc typically, are things that you stick on which will erode, if you know physics. So the metal erode is the cathode that erodes. So they put all these zinc or aluminium cathodes everywhere to make sure that while sitting on the water, the platform doesn't erode. Everybody knew that or am I? This is me standing here, can you see?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
The concept is clear, yeah, just to eliminate, yeah.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
And this is where the tightening happens, can you see? Now the riser, this is the riser coming down.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's already pre-installed.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
And here there's a flange, and the tie-in, tie-in to this. So you can imagine, you can't have a pipeline straight into it, because if it expands, it'll push the platform. So they put the Z piece here, like this, on the seabed, and then, oop, what happened?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Oh my god, did I do something wrong?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, sorry.

Madhavan, Tara:
So that's that. So I hope that helps.

Patel, Rahul:
So on the rig itself, it looks something like this. So there's a lot of gadgets, a lot of materials, and you can imagine, they could have paint for the floor and to slip, you know, they could have anything. And for the drilling, for the jackup, I mean, this is a fixed platform, but there could be a lot materials they can even have scaffolding you know they can have the you know something to do with a heli heli deck uh lights uh so it's not everything to do with downholdering I'm sure your bomb is full of stuff uh safety gear obviously is is one which is um is very frequent procurement um that will go as part of the operations okay so that's I was standing on the flare can you see the flare here the stairs so I climbed the flare, the flare which looks like, let me just see if there's a flare, that flare here, see

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
that flare?

Patel, Rahul:
So if there's something comes out of the ground which needs to burn, it goes out and it's flared away from the deck. So there's a flare. You see them sometimes burning, yeah? So what I did here is climb on the flare. So anyway, it gives you, there's always a crane, so crane also has materials. There's tubular, as you can see, everything's tubular goods. Everywhere. This is a typical diving support vessel standing next to the jacket.

 You can see the top side of this part is still not installed. There's a leg here without something on top of it. That was in the middle of a shell project. It's half done, so it's still working on it. We were doing the tie-in, installing the spool. A spool using one of those. That's a pipeline being installed. You can see the weld here. Don't laugh at my jacket. Remember I told you there's a big manifold that ties all the pipelines up?

 This is what it looks like, Do you know why it's at an angle? It's at an angle because these will have covers on them. Again, there's a lot of parts that goes into that material. But this is like the manifold that sits on top of the well and probably has the Christmas tree inside it. And it's protected by this wellhead protection structure, because if somebody drags an anchor, it goes dong, dong, and dong again, right?

 And so it's like a pyramid shape, so the anchor can go up and down without dragging the pipes. And then you'll see- This is called a wellhead. This entire thing is called a wellhead. This is a wellhead protection structure and inside it there's the wellhead manifolds and chrismas tree and gear. So you put this on top of the well. But I was just commenting on this design of it, it's designed so anchors do not snatch it.

 There's a lot of fishermen by the way in North Sea that go around dragging their fishing stuff or their anchors in oil fields so they can get a compensation claim. They don't realize that millions of damage in the well, they care more about the fishing net and their anchor. And there's a fisherman's association that can get claims. So they put a structure to make sure that even if somebody tries to smash the wellhead, they can't.

 It's a bad world we live in. Okay, so you got that. Now the other part I was going to show you. So these are, I just picked some slides here. So these are Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Weatherford, Cameron, these are all drilling and supplies. I don't know if you see any supplies, but maybe the bomb will have... Yeah, we've heard this name, Schlumberger, a lot. Okay, good. So these are the big ones.

 Can you see the size of them, right? I mean, some of it is the biggest. Look at the market cap. Okay, these are the industry players. I thought I'd show you that. Okay. And The specialities, I mean, some of them are camera, like it's subsea only. Okay. Trans-ocean is just drilling. Submarine does everything. Exploration, drilling, technologies, surveying, et cetera. Guys, I got somebody at the door.

 I need a two-minute break. Do you want to take just a two-minute break, or would that be okay? Did anyone join the technical call?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah Rahul.

Patel, Rahul:
So we were in the technical call only. Sagar and I have joined.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Switched to that call.

Sheth, Kunal:
So Kaiser is on sick leave today. So only Buruj team was available. Available, Nishant and Ananda. So we have set up a call today around 3 p.m. Time to start working on the integration activity.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Sheth, Kunal:
And he's also raising a new firewall request for Buruj to because now they are asking for a range of IP addresses instead of a single IP because of the dynamic nature of change.

Patel, Rahul:
Okay, got it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
So Kunal, you joined that technical meeting. I saw that it started and ended in 16 minutes.

Sheth, Kunal:
So you were on the call, right?

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Yeah, yeah. Myself and Sagar has joined the call.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So we have aligned with Yashanta. Great. Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
So more probably next step since we have now looked at the file we have looked at the bomb so we have some open questions which we need to send to add now so we have input from go SCM team on the questions they have plus we'll add some more questions from our side and we then will review that email once with Kinan so that when we send it back we are aligned in terms of the top Yeah, I

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
think and we repeat those because I also need to leave. Yes, I mean us validating questions or even some write up that we do referring to this area and drilling. It's good for Kenan just to cross check it so that it has the right context. It doesn't look like we're connecting words without any proper meaning. Yeah, and at the same time for other sessions where we know that it will be either them detailed walkthrough or talking to us about their current material, et cetera.

 I think having Kinnan is essential, so we're aligned with them on. I think the moment we'll have them in one or two sessions, that concern will be shut down in terms of do we have the right expertise or not. And we'll tell them as required, we can have Kinnan, but also now the team is, let's say, has the right background but when we need an SME, Kinan is available. Yeah, because we have quite a few months.

 We don't want this issue to keep popping up saying, oh, you don't know this term that term. No, we have the right experts, but also we do not want everyone to be in every meeting just to be efficient.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, and probably we can align also with Kinan in terms of how we define the Bill of Materials so that we are not making sure it's from a drilling perspective.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
We are considering all the possibilities. Yeah, that's what I meant. But also as we articulate or build, replay our understanding, that's a no-brainer. But this is us behind the scenes.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, we just want to make sure we run through the solution once with Kinan so that we are not probably completely off in terms of promising something which functionally we may not be able to deliver. I don't want to get into a situation. While we are aligned, I think running through Kinan once will help us make sure that we are confident about the solution.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah. I might need to drop. Not sure about the rest. I'll wait for Kenan and just leave. But yeah, let's just confirm those next steps and he can share with us also the slides that he was presenting.

Patel, Rahul:
So maybe I would if everyone is available, maybe I would like to run through the files which are not shared with us. Maybe 510 minutes with Conan so that. We can summarize this next steps defined for next meeting.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, make sure whomever should be on the call is still there. If not, then you can send that to Kenan and get the feedback or book another 30 minutes separately. This way, whatever Kenan shares back, it's not only you who's listening or receiving it. Everyone who should be aware of that is on the call. Let's check now. I think we have, I don't think Bastián joined, but we have Sagar, Hector, more Kunal.

 We have the change management team also. And yeah, Kush Bhutara. We'll see if Hector can relay that to the rest of the team between Hector and Sagar, that should be fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi again, guys.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Okay, so. So look, I mean, at the end of the day, this is this is a good introduction. So at least but I think I think people will have to um to also you know look at those videos I sent them and also uh try to to do some uh some research and if there's any terms and

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I'm happy to help as well yeah that's what I wanted because I need to drop also keenan so as I as you mentioned as next step so we'll check the slides please show with us the ones that you highlighted as important, because I couldn't find all the slide numbers when they disappeared at the bottom, but you can share those with us. The team would like to check something related to... Sorry?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'll share the useful ones for sure. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
So we'll do the homework.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'm just seeing if I got any more useful stuff. I think Maybe I'll share this particular slide. This is part of a KPMG deliverable. But I could share stuff like that. But I think I've covered most of the terms now on the other one. I don't think there's anything more. This is what that mud looks like, Yeah. More like glue. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this might be useful.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
What we'll do, as you said, we'll do a homework. So we'll check the material you'll send, cross-check this with whatever information we needed to provide, whether through BOM or also some questions. Either send them by email, or maybe we can have a quick discussion. And definitely, as we move to replaying the design that we have in mind into the system, I think it will be good for you to join us. As Raoul and the team mentioned, either one, to give them that SME assurance, two, to make sure whatever we're referring to as optimisation is actually feasible.

 It's not like we're referring to it from a different perspective, like MRO, and it's not applicable in drilling or vice versa.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, just one last thing then, Mohamed. I've got this. I'm not sure if it's useful, but I've got this in the past where it's more like a process taxonomy. It shows, you know, to manage drilling, what kind of processes there are. So I'm not sure if that helps anyone.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Mo, Fakhoury, is any of this or parts of this are relevant to or related to our discussion? I think we can check them.

Patel, Rahul:
This is a drilling process.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
It can also help us in terminology. It doesn't hurt. It's more about terminology.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, you're right.

Patel, Rahul:
And again, that's what we need to understand.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I didn't share those with you before, Mo. But while I was looking for stuff for today, I came across this in my old files. So this is like, for example, contract drilling rig. But I'm not sure this fits well with this project, but it may give you background right it's not necessarily but it will help us with the terminologies yeah probably the sequence of events so when materials exactly right yeah so emergency response I don't know maybe this one is not but the value train the full sequence yes yeah the kind of what you do so somebody says we get this material during the wireline log well where the hell is the wire long well that's the bit you do before the case So you know what I mean?



Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
So it may help you to understand what stage materials are required.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, absolutely. I agree.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah. OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Anything else? So, Raoul, if you want to run the bomb, I'm not sure if Kinan has more time.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, I might drop, but go ahead. How long do you think you need? Kinan, if you have time, maybe 10 minutes.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
My guest just arrived, so could you email it to me and I'll call you on it this afternoon? Let's send it, Raoul, and check the questions we need.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Kinan, once you have the chance, check it, please. And then we can have a shorter session later, if not today, I think might be too short of a notice today, next week, so that you can give us, because this way we'll make sure all the team, the relevant team members are also there who are building the solution around it.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Fair enough?

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
Sounds good.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Thanks a lot. OK, I hope you enjoyed that guy, but yeah, it's a nice change.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 1:
I think it was.

Conference Room (Naamani, Mohamad) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, that was a very good session.

Patel, Rahul1:
Thank you.

Patel, Rahul:
Thanks everyone. Thank you. Thank you.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Thank you. Thank you.
