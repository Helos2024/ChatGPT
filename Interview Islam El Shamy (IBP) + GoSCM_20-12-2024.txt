We are planning mostly on this project is MRO, so I know that they have the full supply chain network and finally they are selling the oil to the same people, right? I've been there, I've seen the gas stations, but we are not taking the finished products, you know, it's only MRO and chemical products and in this case drilling materials.\n\n So, yeah, that's good, yeah. So Islam, I hear that you are applying for a position here on the company related like a semi-senior consultant, something like that. That is what they told me. So, well, the idea is that I will take the opportunity to ask you some questions. Usually what we do on interviews is like people that want to enter to the company, usually it's very new. They are just finishing college, right?\n\n And finding the first job. And then, well, they take some courses because we have IBP courses inside of the company. And they take one and then they do the presentation and all that. So I'm very used to that. In your case, it's not going to make sense because you already have experience. So, the idea is that I guess that let's try to do a more normal interview. In this case, I tell you a little bit about myself.\n\n I'm an architect here on GoSCM, also the learning manager. I've been working like my whole career here. I started like a junior consultant working on IP and now working as an architect. So my whole experience is fully ADP, basically. And I'm from Chile, originally, and now I'm living in Spain. I've been living like two years here in Spain with my wife and basically taking breaks here on the zone. I took one break on Europe here on Spain, but also was across the region and a little bit in Africa.\n\n And now I'm participating also as an architect on another project, right? So, well, that's a little bit about me and that's why they are asking me to interview you because I know about the tool so I can make sure how well you are handling the topics and so on. The idea is that you tell me about yourself. I read your resume but I think that it's better if you try to do a summary of what is your experience.\n\n I know that's you've been working more than IVP, so tell me about that, please."},{"start_time":1734710844795,"end_time":1734711124116,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"Yeah, so let me share with you my journey in SAP in general. So first I've graduated from business administration domain, and then I've joined like a scholarship or internship in the Ministry of Telecommunication here in Egypt. There's nine programs, like a diploma, of nine program month, where we studied like many, many topics, but the major was the ERP. So we studied four modules of the ERP, like the FIM, MSD, and so on, CO, and so on.\n\n But we take like many other courses for soft skills and for programming, even like C++, Java, whatever. But I don't remember any of these courses anymore. But yeah, then after I I joined one company here in Egypt called LAPS, Logical Application for Business Solutions, but I've started my career as a PS consultant, Project Systems. That's right. So, yeah, so I've started learning the project systems, project management and so on.\n\n And for about like, this was for about like eight just PS consultants, but in our company, In this company, we got like a project in IPP and there's no one in the market knows about IPP. And we have this project, it's critical. We need someone to like go on and do the project. So they asked me if I'm okay with that. I'm okay to learn IPP and go. So I was learning IPP just like one month before doing the project and continue learning while I'm on site with the customer, but you know, because I understand the supply chain because I was taking like course in supply chain also.\n\n So I know the business, how the business works. So it was like easy for me to study or to learn about IBP. Also the best practice was very helpful because they give you like a business cases or the full picture or how the scenario integrate together. So the best practice was very helpful at this moment because I was not able to study or to read all the academy books like IBP, IBP, and so on. So it was like no time to study or to cover all the materials.\n\n So the best practice was good at this moment. But meanwhile, on the project, I studied the academy, but not also the academy, and take the supply, the certificate for the IBP. And for this project, exactly, it was like a painting manufacturing company in Saudi Arabia called Al Jazeera, one of the biggest paint manufacturing in the Middle East. And I was only the one man show in the project, but from that functional side, but there's also the technical side and the CPI or these technicalities was another team.\n\n So in this project, I was responsible for mainly demand and sales and operation planning, SOP. So this was mainly the two modules they have got in this project. And after this project, I joined PwC, here in Egypt also, to lead the team, or actually to build the team for the IBP, because also I was the only IBP consultant at this moment. So I was taking the responsibility to build a team and a company.\n\n Also, I've joined other projects in PwC because we here in ETEC or in PwC Egypt, we act as like a delivery center for different territories in Europe. So we are a delivery center to UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Middle East. So for about like two years, I was working with the UK team. So I've done like three projects, like Centauri, Megger and Epson. But there's a big team, I'm not the only man showing these projects, because PwC and the big four are not working alone on these projects.\n\n So I've participated in these three projects. And after that, for the past nine months or maybe a year, I was acting again as a PS consultant. So if there's no other projects, then go act as a PS consultant.

So for the demand planning, I believe the most or the most important features in this module, let me say it in this way, of course, is the statistical forecasting with the algorithms and so on. So the give you the insights about your forecasting and can choose the best fit model based on your products and the nature of your product. So it's like a combination between the time series analysis where the system can make the analysis for your products and what is the nature.\n\n It's like a stable demand or it's a seasonal or whatever. So based on the nature of your product and based on the many algorithms in the system can give you a best forecast model. So this is the main feature in the demand planning. Of course, with the segmentation or the ABC segmentation, so it can give you a better way to manage your products. If you have thousands of products, you can classify your products and know what you can focus on, what you need, what needs human interaction and what can let the system propose the values or propose that demand and so on and How you can yeah, and also how we can Clean or cleanse your your historical data based on the also the Algorithms to correct or the outlier correction in the in the system the outline features So I believe these are the most important features in the demand of course with the other features like the demand sensing, of course, if you can capture the insights on a daily basis, how you can, you know, adjust to your demand plan.\n\n Also, of course, there's like a common features across all the IPP modules, like the alerts or the dashboard, how we can use the dashboards and you can create your own analytics and so on. So this is also one of the most important features across all the modules because the customer actually loves the dashboards and how you can drill down into the dashboard and get more insights. Also the good part also of this module is that the planner himself or the customer themselves can create the dashboards easily.\n\n It's very friendly so they can create their own dashboards and their own Have you been able to work on the, just out of curiosity, on the analytics stories?"},{"start_time":1734711542067,"end_time":1734711562873,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Because we are finding right now, for example, that, you know, that is a new dashboard functionality that is much nicer, but here on UAE, it's not enabled.

So the system can give you the initial or the first insight, and then if you have a local demand planner, he can also give his insight. There is a global demand planner, so this is how the best practice works. So we can have different insights from different departments or even from from different hierarchy in the same company.\n\n So we have the insight from the local demand planner, from the global demand planner. But if we need to have a collaboration between different departments, here it's more in the SOP. So we have this like a flow of gathering the information, like it's the normal flow of the SOP. So you have the interviewer and so on. But we can do the same also in the demand, because it's all about key figures and how we can maintain the values.\n\n So anyone can maintain his values, of course, based on the authorizations and so on. So we can maintain these inputs from different departments. And we can finally have our consistent demand at the end of the review cycles. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Of course, we can have also different insights in the demand planning. For example, for the holidays, for example, if we need like, if there is like a specific season for the products, we can maintain this in the seasonality or in our calendar.\n\n So it's like, it's called like correlation, correlation key figures, something like that. So where we can maintain like the events, for example, in Middle East, There is a Ramadan Yeah, so whatever the season or whatever the the upcoming events you can maintain this or flag this events or in the Upcoming yes, so or in the future. It can protect or can give like wait for this events and so on so That is it's moving right?\n\n It's not always the same date So that's that's why we need like to market or flag these weeks or these days manually in the system. So yeah, so for all the upcoming Ramadan, you need to give them the same flag, for example, if you have another events, we can give it another flag. And so on. So the system can consider these events in the future. Yeah. Also, one of the other insights, for example, in the event sensing, you can give the insights, you can get this insights of the BOS, for example, or, you know, We can give the weather insight, for example, if it sends a calculation.\n\n So whatever insights we can give it to the system. And that's what I love about the IBP. It's customizable. You can do whatever you want. Yeah, create the key figures, whatever you want, and do calculations yourself and so on."},{"start_time":1734711978573,"end_time":1734711982426,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Yeah, you find the correlation between this and the variables."},{"start_time":1734711982426,"end_time":1734711984353,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"It's the multivariable approach, basically."},{"start_time":1734711984353,"end_time":1734711984739,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yeah."},{"start_time":1734711984739,"end_time":1734712020295,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"That's great, Ben. All right, then just one question that I also, as always, if we have the, it can be maybe a very basic one, but let's go. If we have the statistical forecast and we have even multivariable models sometimes that you can put variables, why do we need the input from other departments? This is more process-wise than IDP-wise. From where again? From other departments like marketing, sales, where do we need the input?\n\n"},{"start_time":1734712020295,"end_time":1734712097824,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"Well, as I stated in the beginning, we can manage by exceptions. So, for example, we have this ABC segmentation that will help us to focus on the critical products. So, if we have several products in our company, there's no need to have human insights for all these products. So, there is a very stable product or there is a backing product that can follow the other product and so on. So no need to get the insights for all the products in the company.\n\n So that's why we have this ABC segmentation. So, for example, you can only focus on the A products. For example, this is what needs human interaction. Yeah. And also because the system will never replace the humans, I believe. So there is insights. For example, if I know that in the In the upcoming Month, there is a promotion for example or whatever from the marketing. So the system doesn't know that there is a promotion So I need to tell the system there's a promotion next next month or even in the other side Maybe you are we are closing this Plan for specific reasons.\n\n Yeah, so also we need to give this insight to the to the system So it can give us like a more accurate, you know Exactly at the end."},{"start_time":1734712097824,"end_time":1734712132482,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"They're not it everything can be inferred from the history.

Some companies have a very, very simple approach, like you have the forecast, they replace it.

But it can give you some of the demand planning for algorithms, but not the sophisticated ones. It can give you the supply planning, but also not the sophisticated supply planning, just heuristic to review the insights about you the long-term planning. So the SOP is all about the long-term planning.\n\n It's not a medium-term planning. It's mostly focused on the bottlenecks that you will face in the future. So it can give you the insights to take strategic actions. For example, if you want to have a new production line, for example, based on the demand. So if you expect a huge demand in the future, but you see this bottleneck, you can make a strategic decision, maybe buy a new production line or work another shift in the production so it can increase the capacity and so on.\n\n So mainly focus on the strategic level, but also give you these insights and also follow the standard structure or the standard process of SOP where you make the demand review, supply review, execution review, and so on, all this cycle. So it can make this as a workflow and have this task and assign this task to a specific department or a specific person so it can follow the process of the SOP. So this is what I love about SOP.\n\n It can give you the features or the functionality of many modules, but with a limited features, so any company can start with the SOP first and then can build on the SOP afterwards.

You give him the story of the functionality, not just the functionality. This function do want 1, 2, 3, you give him the story. For example, the demand runner needs to do x, y, z.

I don't know if we have translated into a user story. But I mean, most of the methodology right now we are following KPMG because are working with them on this project, they are taking more tracks, we are taking the technology side. And it has been happening to me a lot lately because I've been working, like, I work remotely for a project in the US with Capgemini, then when I work here in Spain, I work with Entity Data, and now I'm working on Unlock Middle East with KPMG.\n\n So it's like jumping between partners, you know, so like grabbing some methodology. We also have internal methodology. We are trying to push a lot on that, especially that now with CMM as a company, we are growing a lot. You know, when I started in the company like seven years ago, or I think that eight, we were like only 10 on Chile. I was like the first junior consultant to be hired. The first guy that didn't know anything about IBP and they starting just starting working and so on.\n\n And we start building the knowledge. So IBP on Chile was like a focus for IBP where we concentrate concentrated knowledge and start like spreading this to Argentina, to Brazil, to Peru, you know, then to Mexico as well. And basically the whole South America and also a little bit on North America and to enter these markets because we started growing a lot now we are like 200 people and we are in continuous growth and we are trying to enter these markets and for the for example the U.S.\n\n It's like impossible if you are not with a partner that is already established there it's impossible they are only sharks and so we go with Capgemini and these kind of companies and here in Spain the same with Entity Data just to enter because no matter how many successful projects you have on South America, here is Europe, you know, so they are going to measure by European projects. And the same, so we enter with a partner, we release the same, but the point on GoSCM, like the big difference with the big four is like we are completely specialized.\n\n So we do mostly ADP. We are also doing, trying to push on the logistics side, like it's 400, and then the GM trust management, the extended warehouse management, right? But mostly AVP. And most of the experts we have on the team are AVP specifically. So Middle East sounds like a market with a lot of potential. I mean, that's why we are investing here. We already have a consultant on Egypt. Isomar is part of my team indeed.\n\n And we are trying to hire people on Egypt as well. It's a very good place to hire people, I think, for the company. And so, yeah, that's the study. And, well, I really like the interview so far. I've seen that you are wasting material. I've seen that you are one of us. You know a lot. And I don't know if you have any question of the company because, as I told you, I've been working here my whole life.\n\n I haven't changed company. That means to me something. Um, if you need to ask me anything and I can be really honest with you, uh, this is opportunity So your headquarter in spain or in chile Right now I'm I'm located on spain. Uh, but the the company is international. I mean we have The big hubs right now are in chile on argentina because in argentina we wrote we wrote a lot. There are a lot of um guys that are just Finishing college and starting taking a job and we have like 25% of the companies in that is Argentinian right now and then we also have a big hub on Mexico in Mexico is that we're all started there is a Crazy German guy.\n\n There is our the owner of the company. It's really nice. I mean crazy, but in the good sense he founded West CM like 12 years ago probably or 10 years ago and he started on Mexico and and they were trying to push on the US as well, but the US is difficult. They hired my boss, Felipe, that now is the CEO of the company, on the US, and he decided to go to Chile, because he's Chilean, and to start OSCM there, and pushing IBP practice.\n\n And that's how all started, exploded, and then we stopped being like different hubs, but now being just as a whole international company. So yeah, most of the 40% is Mexican, the 25% in Argentina, then we have a lot of people also in Chile. In Brazil, we have a half as well right now. And we have some people in Peru, not a lot, but we have some. In other countries, maybe we have one, two, you know.\n\n And then we are pushing the sun. Europe, we are a lot of people here, but mostly people like me that's reallocating here to live in Europe.

It's a lot of growth potential. We see a lot of opportunities and that is what they are saying to us. That is what they are talking with SAP as well, because we are always trying to have the communication. Of course, right? Indeed, the Madrid offices are just right by SAP. That is a strategy to be very close to them.\n\n And well, that's why we are hiring people here the sun on Spain, on Egypt, we have people in India, we have like four consultants right now, three of them are working on the AdNod project as well. And yeah, then so that that I think that the opportunity is good because the when you enter to a company that is growing, you grow with the company. The rotation here on GoSEUM is very low as well. It's like 14% I think.\n\n I think that then the in the big four is much bigger bigger the rotation. So it's a different kind of company because it's not a big firm, for sure. It's a niche company.

So, if you like the snorkeling and scuba diving and so on. So, Red Sea in Egypt is one of the best places on Earth for this kind of activity. So, there is a blue hole in the Hab. This is like the deepest point in Earth, for example, if you want to do the scuba diving and snorkeling and so on.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734713751049,"end_time":1734713753139,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"It's something that you do?"},{"start_time":1734713753139,"end_time":1734713753557,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Sorry?"},{"start_time":1734713753557,"end_time":1734713758573,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"It's something that you do?

I didn't do scuba diving before, but snorkeling there is fantastic. I went there to Dahab and Al-Qaeda and so on. So Red Sea is amazing for the coral reefs and this kind of activity. And of course, the Mediterranean Sea is good for the swimming The water is very clear and so on. So we have these two kind of differences. Also, if you wanted to visit the historical scenes and so on, you need also to go down there in Aswan and Luxor.\n\n So it's called Upper Egypt, because Egypt is like that. So this is Upper Egypt. This is the Nile and the Mediterranean. So the Upper Egypt is full of the temples and so on. So you would be astonished by the...

I usually don't like to support a lot on sales because I'm full activities. Then Omar for example that is a consultant from Egypt he came here like two weeks ago maybe because we have like this go day we call it but it's like the typical company closure end of the year session that you have and we meet in Argentina all these little guys are meeting meeting the young guys and chill and all the places we have big hubs.\n\n And also we did it on Madrid two weeks ago and Omar that was on Egypt, they sent, they brought Omar here as well, to know the team, you know, because he's working mostly remote. So, well, the team that is working on farming overseas has been on Egypt, but not the other way around. So, yeah. So, yeah. Opportunities are really nice as well that is what I like of this job that is that gives you the international opportunities well the English working on English you know like working with other cultures like you have been done based on your resume and what you have been telling me about UK and so on so yeah this is more of that um just a question for you man this is not much my side you know this is something that the human resources is shaking.\n\n Why you are interested on YCM, like switching from the big four to this company?"},{"start_time":1734713929171,"end_time":1734713971263,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"Well, I've been asked this question before.

Why not to know more about other companies to more know more about other opportunities you know so I'm just exploring the market yeah maybe it's it's a better opportunity I I don't know so I will I will not I will not be sure unless I you know go in this opportunity or go in this you know discussion yeah I need to to have the discussion to know more about the opportunity and to assess if it's a better or"},{"start_time":1734713971263,"end_time":1734714026252,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"not yeah yeah I think that is a good opportunity because you you are allowed of course in big force I would say that there if you continue in a career you can grow like in crazy levels right if you get to to be a partner there that is something that only a big four can give you right but on GoSCM I think that you can grow a lot because what I've been seeing is that GoSCM consultants say they learned a lot uh we are very on hands on the working um And I've seen the difference.\n\n I mean, talking with you, I can tell that you're very good, but I've been working with guys from KPMG and I don't feel that they are like the same level, you know, consultancy. So I think that the opportunity to work here on this company, there is a lot, there is a lot, especially because we are so specialized as well."},{"start_time":1734714026252,"end_time":1734714055758,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"Yeah, it's the same scenario here in Egypt also. In the local vendors or the local partners, you are like, you need to work a lot, you need to engage in different, you know, things, like what I did before, like, they just pushed me in another, in this project, in the IGP, so I learned about IGP, yeah. So, you have this opportunity in the local partners or the local vendors, but yeah, yeah, it's the same, what God calls here, yeah.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734714055758,"end_time":1734714141153,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"We have a, we have a saiyan, on Spanish, he's called Circo Pobre, or like a circus you know with the lions the clowns and all that but poor poor circus so everyone is doing everything because they don't have clowns they don't have lions you know you need to do everything and that is something that indeed happens a lot on this company when I just started I needed to jump really quickly and learn really quickly and in some moments was really stressing but if you are up to the challenge that means that you can grow very very fast and that is what has been happening and well that depends on you I mean if you want to have more balance and you can you want to stop a little bit because that's like my strategy like I do a jump then I count a little bit then I do a jump and so on so the jumps are really stressful but it's really nice then after doing the jump to see like the panoramic the new view is really great so that kind of a opportunities you can find here.\n\n So if you are up to the challenge, if you are ambitious, I think that OSGM really like that people and it's going to push you and give you activities. And if you are not leading a project and you say, no, I want to lead a project right now, well, do it. And you jump and you start doing it.

Yeah, it was a really nice talk. I will say that I really liked you, that based on what we discussed, I really can say that you can understand, you understand very well. So hopefully, you are also interested in joining the company. I think that you a good opportunity and well then after this interview I think I don't know your case because for you it's kind of different we I'm always interviewed as new new guys like just out of college but usually after the interview with me then you can interview with Camilo.\n\n Camilo is the COO he's a Mexican guy really nice really funny really he's a really good person and I don't know if in that meeting you also will have the opportunity to meet with Felipe that is the CEO also a crazy guy in the good sense very competitive you know that this this kind of guys are like very very good and work like crazy um and I think that's it if you if you go to the interview with them it's like more casual I think uh you can ask Yara by the way she knows better than me but I think that the last interview is like more casual like to get to know each other basically what we did at the last half an hour, but with them, right?\n\n So if you do the match and then basically if you like it and they will like you, I'm pretty sure, then you can take the opportunity."},{"start_time":1734714252828,"end_time":1734714258720,"speaker":{"name":"Islam"},"words":"Thank you, Hector.
