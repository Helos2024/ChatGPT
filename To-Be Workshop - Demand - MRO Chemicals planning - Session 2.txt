As it was mentioned, this planning calendar has a monthly frequency, although there is one activity that has a quarterly frequency, OK? So of course, we're going to address here in more detail the demand planning part, just to keep in mind that in future sessions, we're also going to address in more detail planning calendar and the supply planning calendar, okay?\n\n So, before going step by step, I want to highlight the fact that most of these activities have one responsible, okay? That probably is going to be someone that has some business knowledge, but also IT knowledge. So, this calendar is a series of steps that are designed to make sure we get a good quality output from the demand planning process, okay? And the idea is to make it simple. The idea is not to overwhelm you with activities that add no value, okay?\n\n So keep that in mind. So let's review activity by activity. Master data integration and validation and then transactional data integration and validation. Well, it can happen on a weekly basis, the master data integration as well as the transactional data integration. But the important thing is that when the statistical forecast and the collaboration start, we have all the portfolio, all the material that we need, and also we have an updated version of the historical consumption and the rest of the key figures we need.\n\n For these two activities, we need a response As I said, it's going to be someone from the business that maybe can check, can review, can validate that all the materials are there, all the transactional is there, but most of the users won't be responsible for this activity, right? They will just receive an input saying, okay, the system is ready. Then segmentation and classification review. This is partly even in its most it's very likely that just a few products, a few materials will change their segmentation in a year.\n\n So it's not an important step, at least on a monthly basis. New part introduction, here we need a business expert that can basically define which is the reference that will serve to create the forecast for the new materials.

We're going to review in more detail how it's gonna be this collaboration in the next slide, okay?\n\n So we will receive the input from production, we will receive then the input from the inventory planner. And then at the end of the week two, there needs to be a final review. I don't know if there's any responsible for like for chemical portfolio. But the thing is that someone on a more senior level needs to check this number.

What was the forecast for December in August?\n\n So on and so forth.

Two things for the user advantage. One is that they can use the system to propose a requirement to the inventory team through the IBP, like work order, similar to work order. Also, the system proposes the user based on the past conception For a given item number, what will be the forecast?\n\n Currently, I think every user or the process user, operation user is calculating what is required for next year or future manually based on the past demand, right? And the operation plan for future. Maybe the operation is increased or the operation is reduced for various other reasons. So this input analysis can be done in the same IBP tool. It will propose you the forecasted quantities. Per frequency, the user can have a chance to validate it, correct it based on their manual inputs, and release it for the inventory for further consideration.\n\n This facility is there in IBP.

So first of all, we have reference key figures that will help you to make your final decision.\n\n In this case, it's last year consumption. But we can add prior two years consumption, average, and we will define all these KPIs that will add value to your analysis. Then we have the statistical forecast. What is the system? Then we have, OK, we will have this word operational input, as you like it to call, and then the inventory input. So for January 2025, we have that the last year consumption was 9,000.\n\n The statistical forecast is 10,000. But the operational input was 5,000. But in this case, the inventory input said, no, that's too low. I'm going to increase it So this is the final number. For February, again, the last year was almost The statistical forecast is increasing, 11,000. The production input, 6,000. In this case, the inventory input made no input.

Of course, once the month has passed, we will be able to measure each one of the letters, and we will be able to identify who is more accurate.
