See, this is not a we are not asking you to confirm on behalf of anybody, anything, but we just want to understand in the maintenance, say for example, there could be mechanical items, there could be electrical items, there could be other type of items. In the plan, is there a planner for this specific type of items? Is there a, say, one planner group or something because for us, or is it like the review by plant section or what organization unit is involved in interviewing?\n\n How can you segregate? For example, assume that the MRP, there is a proposal of say 500 items. Now, I don't want to show and we are asking the user, to review and correct the forecast.

Maybe it's the same motor, then the motor might be some instrumentation failure has happened.\n\n So there will be instrumentation team will be working.

Assume that this is plant 1 and this is plant 2 and this is plant 3.\n\n Now in this plant, there is a mechanical item. And here also there is a mechanical item. And here also there is a mechanical item. Just for our example, this mechanical item is linked to the MRP controller A1. This also A1. And this also A1. In the shared services, then it will become like this. Basically there is one MRP controller. Assume that this one MRP controller is Vignesh. This A1 represents me.\n\n So what is happening here? I am responsible for mechanical items.

Sometimes you have this information on C tables, and I'm sure that you have, so that is, but we need to understand what we need to integrate.\n\n And then when we go to more technical sessions with the integration team, we need to understand what is going to be the mapping for each one of those hierarchies.

So definitely, we have actually a senior partner who is with us on the project and we're happy to, usually he either works with the team behind the scenes, but he also joins certain meetings. Now, we're happy to have meeting with so this senior partner used to work actually before joining consulting used to be in the oil and gas industry with the Halliburton or similar companies on drilling sites so on and so forth so he knows the whole business and is with us now from a consulting perspective more on the supply chain or the business not the digital we have another definitely senior partner for digital so that's to make sure to give you the comfort that yes Now, the senior partner also is working with our team on whatever is needed in terms of some actual part of the business value chain, process steps that are specific to drilling, so on and so forth.\n\n Now, I think the recent sort of disconnect that happened, in my or in our opinion, is less of a drilling know-how, but it's, as you mentioned, we need to maximize the And then after that, we will agree on what are basically still missing attributes that you do not have today. I always give the example of BOM or it could be one example or some master data that IBP relies on that today we couldn't find.\n\n Maybe it turns out that it's another extract you need to do or it's there and we missed it. But I think you're right. We'll start with the bulk of what we received, try work with you just to make sure we're efficient. Also if we want to do the mapping between the extract you provided in September, and now, uh, if we have any clarification, we'll do this. After which we will continue now the drilling concept, especially or our process team, the team that worked on the process flow, etcetera.\n\n They also have this background. However, to make sure that you have you and the team do not have any concern. We're happy to have another session Especially since now in the BPD we injected all of those Points related to in the BPD for drilling versus BPD for a model or chemicals We added those specifics. So just bear with us I don't think we have any issues and understanding or even SME and resources, but we just need to Connect maybe more and have that discussion so that you're also and the business team are comfortable with that.\n\n Fair enough. So it's a journey, as they say. Three months, I mean, we're also designing multiple things. I don't think given the full project timeline, it's a long duration. But yes, you need to feel that after those three months, now the solution is there is a flavor for drilling, just like there's a flavor for MRO, et cetera. And that's our plan to work with you on.

First of all, the mainly on the technical aspect.\n\n So the what are they understanding? What do you need? Then you put it there and try to grab some information again and so the drilling team to work again. For the this part of this project and so instead of now working with the their data so what they recommend so let's transform the the information they called material allocation plan MAP this is the final product they shared with us so we put it in the complete sheet and once it may be Rahul if you can share I can guide you what the they explained to me last day.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734602930333,"end_time":1734602934908,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Maybe you can share your screen."},{"start_time":1734602934908,"end_time":1734602969617,"speaker":{"name":"Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC)"},"words":"If you can share the main screen or the main data that's called OCTG.

So, this way we can fix them. So, the remaining the third one they put the completion code over there because the YS is the new concession under the I think Aliasat. So if you I'm just going through the row number 24 then we have completion code and we'll get the brand this is the completion code and we'll get the generic material number 3189426 this is the generic number and the brand number below is the branded number and the if you want detailing of this one is called casing 1338 68 pound weight and LAT is the material grade and TSH blue is the connection this is how they're structured so here they put under the blue itself and they categorized actually so the now the if you if you go to next one Okay so here they put it in the same material with different connection 1338 Jeffy line and the age column edge same material another connection this all the generic the branded number is coming from This is how they explain anyhow so the if you can convert this one then what we can review the data.\n\n We will provide the exact generic number from this one. So this is here. We have one set of the material that 1338 68 pound. This is the four. All are made same material column AF to AI which are 68 pound weight and LAT is the material type material and blue jfuelion WAMTOP and TSH W523 other different different connection.

So Vignesh will connect with you once we have converted this file into something which looks more like a Bill of Materials so that we can define the Bill of Materials for HANA as well."},{"start_time":1734605919028,"end_time":1734605951724,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, Vignesh, as you know, and here's for us the main challenge is that for us. We thought initially, or this is what the information it was provided to us, that the completion code defined the BOM. But as we saw, it's more than that. It's a completion code with some other attributes. So I think if we are able to get that definition, then the BOM definition will be pretty much straightforward."},{"start_time":1734605952103,"end_time":1734605980173,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"We will we will do that you you make that into a table. See what we will do is Rahul and Bastian. From the information that we have, we will construct and we will say that from the information that we have in Excel. This is how we see the bomb. You don't have to be constructed. See after that maybe there is a refinement stage, but what we can do at best is just work on the data that we have. We see so and then.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734605980334,"end_time":1734605996282,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah.
