Roumanos, Hadi:
I was actually referring to Bishir and Tara, not to you.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Where's the fun if it's a straight answer? You're asking how I am. So I came to Royal to meet with Gunjan, but Gunjan got and cancelled the meeting. Then my cab, my taxi to Dubai got delayed 45 minutes, so I'm still at the hotel. You want more details? No, I think it's misery enough.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah, and I saw Bishir actually coming to the hotel also.

Rocio Minguillon:
Hey, team.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello.

Roumanos, Hadi:
So, Kyle, it seems Khaled solved this whole award document discussion for you. Yes, I saw that.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
I didn't know about the marketing stuff, though, to be honest. That's okay. That's okay.

Roumanos, Hadi:
That's usually something that either us or GoICM might want to do during the engagement. He clearly said don't do until we're done with the project.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, that message was to us and Sebastien, more from promoting...

Roumanos, Hadi:
Think of it as using the project as a credential in other proposals, for instance, right?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Which is, yeah, I mean, it's not possible until it's done and we have Ad-Locs approval.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Okay, yeah, but that's... Yeah, out of our hands. We have enough people to get started. Taro? As usual, if you're with us, do you mind popping up that Excel?

Madhavan, Tara:
Yeah, give me a minute.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Sure. You By the time Tara opens it, who do we have from GoSCM besides Rocio? Rocio is always here, Bastian is here. So we were talking to Khaled a couple of days ago, Mohamed and myself, and they mentioned that AdNoc would like to have a demo of the IBP solution sometime soon for their leadership. They didn't mention any urgency, but basically their leaders would like to look at IBP and see how it works, basically, in a nutshell.

 It's probably going to be like a half hour thing at most. So it'll be something that we need to schedule probably within the coming two to three weeks, if I were to guess. I'll add it as a note right now.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And it shouldn't be that big of a fuss. Yeah, it's not a fuss. It's not a big fuss, correct. It's mainly for the digital VP. Mansoori who probably so he's the boss of Firas and Khalid he's ultimately the owner of this project in addition to his SVP boss so it's only like a preview he never saw IVP other than probably attending maybe didn't attend any presentation before during the proof of concept etc so just out of curiosity so he knows what it does maybe a slope from how it reads from SAP, and then seeing that the different screens in demand, supply, inventory.

 Nothing that we should re-engineer or redo. Ideally, it will be on ad hoc instance. This way we'll tell him this is where we are, we're building it, this is how it works, so we don't spend too much time. Again, it's more of building more rapport. The guy didn't join any steel core yet. He only So just connecting with them will help.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's it.

Bastian Osorio:
We can do it through merge that presentation with the unit testing, because we will have plenty of ad hoc information, functionalities for unit testing. So if we can merge those two, it will be, I mean, we will, as you say, kill two birds with one stone. And we can sell it this way.

Naamani, Mohamad:
One, we don't prepare extra. Two, it would look like instead of a demo out of nowhere, or just like an absolute turn, we'll tell him we're on the stage, we'll be happy to show you what we are and how the solution works. Yeah, I agree.

Rocio Minguillon:
Maybe merge it in terms of dates, but maybe in terms of sessions, I will separate it because I think that they expect us to show it, not to do themselves.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, yeah, sure. Especially the attention span of Mansouri is short. So 30 minutes...

Roumanos, Hadi:
The Mansouri session has to be like a one-to-one thing between us and him. Probably Khaled. It can't be a lot of people, I don't think.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, and it's mainly, honestly, stakeholder management. We just want him, he's the owner, just to give him attention. He would definitely ask about, he's the person in the kickoff, most of you attended the kickoff, who stood up at the end, a local guy. This is very important, but I would like also to see how AI is contributing to this. If you remember that intervention, especially that he's a local guy, so you'd remember him.

 So most probably he would say, and anything that we will show how AI is basically enabling it, which we can use whatever we mentioned in in the BPD, or even we're creating a summary slide that Kushboo will help us with, how AI is enabling the solution, not how the solution is an AI solution. Because this is not AI, it leverages AI and algorithms, and we need to give him that comfort. Because again, whomever visited AdNoc, every single screen now is saying energy AI, operations AI, etc.

 So his his boss also will ask him about the same.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. How much of AI he thinks IBP has? If he's expecting, like, show me, like, generative AI creating images. No, no, no.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And this is part of the education or explaining that, actually, the way forecasting solutions work, time series, so on and so I'm trying to learn a bit more about this because this is not chat GPT. This is not a tool or like generative AI where you're asking for content. This is more of AI embedded in processes or supporting automation and accuracy of basically forecasting so on and so forth.

Bastian Osorio:
And also it will be helpful if SAP can accelerate the analytic stories with in requesting this to be in place for months. So of course this makes the things way more, I don't know, fancy. Which one, Basim? Sorry, I'm not sure. The analytic stories is something that it is part of IBP, but for some reason it's not in the UAE server or something like that. Paula is already aware.

Naamani, Mohamad:
part of February release or no?

Bastian Osorio:
No, no, this is a functionality that is the standard. It's in the Fiori. It's some are some fancy reports that are in Fiori. I don't know why they're not part, but yeah, so we don't hijack the whole code.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Let's add this as a point. So had you can add in addition as a comment in this presentation to Mansouri because he will ask so being ready saying actually first even without this analytics feature from SAP we can say this is how it works and actually it is leveraging AI because all forecasting algorithms are machine learning.

Roumanos, Hadi:
So there's two points that we need to add Tara in the end of that document. One is preparation for the leadership demo And you can add, in between brackets, the AI story. I'm saying in between brackets because it's a separate case. But I'm being brief because that's not the point that I want to elaborate here. The second action after this is the Kushboo slide, which we need to track and we need to add a date for, which is the second point I wanted to talk about.

 Because right now, we know about it. Are not tracking it. So this is the AI summary or AI usage within IVP. And now comes my question to Khushboo, which is, do you want us to have a first discussion together with Fakhoury before you start on this slide on your own? Or how is this best done so that you're not left on your own to do it? Because again, progress. We just don't. We can't hide it under the rug and say, uh, until it goes up.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Let me suggest the following. Let's let's put a pointer now. As you mentioned this request that Bastian mentioned from SAP. We need to have separate discussion or a separate call. We might need to call Suleiman telling him about this or even Anand from SAP because he's responsible for whatever is enabled in UAE. So let's add this as an action. The second one I'll let her now answer, but the idea is almost summarizing what we have in the BPD as opposed to coming up with something new.

 It's again like one sheet, one slide that says the way IBP enables or leverages AI is through this. Whenever demand is read, it understands demand and tries to come up with sort of trend. Whenever supply is planned or prepared, Can I interject here?

Roumanos, Hadi:
I don't think it needs to be a summary slide, Mohamed. While the points that show up on this slide are the summary, yes, I think it needs to be a relatively visual slide, because that's a leadership slide, and it needs to be a very easy to read, fancy slide.

Naamani, Mohamad:
The summary, I think, is just for Khaled, if I'm not mistaken. Look, let's take this offline, let's align with him tomorrow. Or Monday, because I'm also concerned about our bandwidth. There are so many things. We just wasted very valuable time with the change management team to review this excellence thing, and then they dropped it. We're learning now to check first. This slide, let's come up with a summary slide first, and then if Khaled says no, because summary slide will not cost us anything.

 It's just an extract from BPD. If it's different, then as we prepare the demo, we might do different visual way, which could be a visual version of this slide. Again, we're now, we should focus more on build. We're very late, so we need to manage Khaled and the team, Hadi, as you know.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Sorry, can you not also maybe refer to the FAQs, Khusbou? There might be some answers there regarding the AR that could help you put that together as well.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah, that's what I was about to say. Since you did that exercise with the same team on understanding their capabilities, we can leverage that as well.

Roumanos, Hadi:
All right. Let's not go through these points one by one. I think everybody here knows what these are, and you all have access to that Excel. I'd rather ask who has an update. On the risks that we have and who wants to add to this list items that we are not aware of so that we can start discussing them as part of this call. Again, that's a way of being a bit more efficient than every day going through that list again and again.

 So to my initial question, does anyone have any risks or issues that they've identified that's not on this list today?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Technical, nothing? No, no, from our side, no, no, no.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, change management, anything?

Campbell, Kyle (UAE):
Yes, Hadi, I mean, this could be a risk, I just want to pose the question. We are doing the change impact assessment, the high-level change impact assessment, and there's a workshop scheduled for next week, Wednesday, and in that we demonstrate the as-is and the to-be processes, as well as the different roles that are involved in it and what the changes are, be it from a technology perspective, governance perspective, process perspective, et cetera.

 But given the MRO changes and we're not 100% sure on what's going to happen with that, and we said that we might communicate that to business later. I don't know, do we proceed with this workshop and do it on the basis of the BPD documents now, with that MRO, or do we have to postpone this workshop now?

Roumanos, Hadi:
I don't like postponing. If doing a workshop now and saying these are living documents that will keep on progressing is an option, then we can do that. I don't want to go to the second Styrko in Jan and have to say that we're not even started in managing that change when it comes to these BRD and BPD processes, right? So I'd rather go there and say we started, we conducted an initial session, but as these documents progress or, you know, get expanded, we'll do another session, right?

 So one story is better than the other.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's my opinion.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I don't know. We'll ask Mohammed as well And take it from there Yeah, yeah, let's not because we need to move into this more at this point Act on it and if there is something changing because that's the nature of the beast

Naamani, Mohamad:
they will always be changes this way We're not we don't get into this vicious cycle trying to perfect something which will never be done. So I agree that that's in this direction. And I think when yesterday or the day before, we were discussing also those points related to what can be done for, I forgot, maybe for drilling, et cetera. It might be the same point, similar. Yes, the users, et cetera, and the process.

 We agreed to show what we have right now. And as we progress, we will say, but there is a difference right now that we mentioned or where we understood your data. I think at the time it was Hector and Bastian. So this would trigger the following show. Yeah, yeah, it's like to be dynamic. So we show progress and we're also wary of us. Not getting too too frustrated because of this way we will never.

 Be able to proceed or prepare for the for the next phases.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, yeah, yeah, that's a more further to add. We had this internal discussion where now that the interface is enabled, the GoSM team is also expediting on this evaluation so that they have the plan between today and tomorrow to evaluate, so that early next week we have a visibility of how the change would turn out to be. So while I agree, we should continue with what we have planned upon, not change the plan.

 This is an additional input from the team as well.

Rocio Minguillon:
This is like a milestone for us that we are starting the integration. So yeah, it's a happy day.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, and maybe you can brief Hadi and the team, Raoul, on the progress on some of those. So there was one thing that we were concerned that it will delay the start of the work with SAP. It's now resolved, I think. But there is another thing that we would need. So just honestly, there are so many Now I'm losing track. So are we in good shape for the integration, but we need to solve something before the Excel add-on.

 Just give us a brief, which would also help add the entire update.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, yeah. So integration point, we are good. This is sorted out. The interface is live and GoSMT. Can you tell Tara which one is it? Or Tara can navigate to this one. Yeah, sure.

Patel, Rahul:
Can you scroll up to the top? I guess it's on the top. It was one of the early ones, Tara. Yeah, the one on the bottom is also a result. Can you go? Yeah. So STD approval, no design board approval today. I have no data.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
There is no interface here.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, I think the one related to interface is on the bottom.

Madhavan, Tara:
Is the other issue we closed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this one is closed. Yeah, no, sorry. Yeah, that's the only point here.

Patel, Rahul:
So I'll have to add something.

Madhavan, Tara:
No, no, this one is closed, right?

Patel, Rahul:
So that was the point. Yeah, yeah, so move this one. The point I was talking about with this this was the last blocker for the interface and which is now closed.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay and that's for the rest of the team I think everyone is aware but just to give the update yeah I think the second is the Excel add-on.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah the Excel add-on is the new point added I think yeah 36.

Roumanos, Hadi:
The Excel add-on is the add-on that takes a long time to get approved, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, 36. So now that Excel add-on, the request has been created. Is raised. We worked with Khalid today. During the day, he needed some technical information, which is provided. Now we'll follow up to make sure that the add-on thing is approved before for the unit testing which is planned in the week of 27 Jan. So that's still a risk. But this is not related to the integration.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, we can, we can work with the integration. Yeah, this is not related to integration. Yeah, this is not, integration is a result.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agree. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Roumanos, Hadi:
But just for Tara's use on row 36, This is still high importance and the next step right now is on Khalid, correct?

Patel, Rahul:
Next step is on AdNoc, not Khalid because Khalid has raised a ticket. Now it will follow the same path as STD where it will get assigned to multiple stakeholders and then we'll have to follow with each and every stakeholder so that they are notified.

Roumanos, Hadi:
The risk is on user testing because if we don't have this here. Yeah, if we don't have this, the user testing will get impacted. And we just need to keep chasing. The reason for high is that user acceptance testing impact and while it's with ad block It's on us to keep to make sure it happens even use you 80 not even you 80 It's earlier unit test even before it's

Patel, Rahul:
unique testing now as we build in the week of 27th.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Okay, so three weeks from now So even more important for us to keep chasing every day to make sure it happens. Yes, exactly Fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. Alright, for the time that we have left.

Madhavan, Tara:
I want to say is how the one thing I want to say is Khalid has said that Rocio Rocio sent details of three consultants who will need AdMob IDs created and later S4 HANA access. So Khalid said he would like to see the CVS and only then he will we can take the next steps. So he has asked me to create requests for user ID, AdMob user ID creation. Because earlier till now he was doing it. He said going forward I can do But only with his approval, he's waiting for the CV.

 So if this is urgent, then, Rocio, you have to share the CVs also urgently.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let me suggest something else, OK? And this is more of a stakeholder management than a process action. It's preferable not to just drop requests on Khaled out of nowhere with names that he doesn't recognize, with roles that he's not expecting, giving them access to Adnox environment. So when we need to do this, let's do it properly by setting a proper call with Khaled saying, hey, for the next few weeks, days, months, we are expanding our team to include these three people, have them on the call, introducing them to Khaled so that, again, it's not a surprise.

 It's something that grows organically within our team. And we can tell him, well, the CVs of these people for your approval, right? The way we did it now is we just sent three names, said we want access, and then obviously Khaled got all spooked. Who are these people? Why are they here? Why do they want access, et cetera, et cetera. So is it something that we can set up? How urgent is this?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, of course, Khaled.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, you're right.

Roumanos, Hadi:
OK, OK. I think it's just easier on the eyes for Khaled to you know to work with us if we if we try and ease him into these things yes yes totally right so it's up to you when we it's up

Rocio Minguillon:
to you when we have that discussion but I think it's important yes definitely definitely yes in this case the two above consultants will help rey and sagar on the on all the modifications uh for the integration that they have to do It's not that urgent because they are, like, working with Sagar and with Rey, with the access of Reinaldo. But, of course, it's good to have their access, so it's also good.

 Also, I had that conversation today with Khalid, and I apologize for the informal, yeah, for the mistake, basically.

Roumanos, Hadi:
No, it's OK. It's OK. It's not a big deal.

Rocio Minguillon:
I'm just saying it's better to do it that way.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah, it's just for taking into account in the next applications.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. OK, OK, OK.

Madhavan, Tara:
Tara, back to you. OK, let me reshare. Anything more on the tracker?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

Patel, Rahul:
On drilling, we had a good discussion with the ad hoc team finally today. So the critical input required is received in terms of data. They were also committed to look at the supply documents. And by end of the day, Monday, they will confirm the feedback on supply documents. So with which now, our team, we need to make sure that we are replying and focusing on closing all the documents so that by Monday we can send the documents for final approval with AdNoc.



Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay, so now our new target date that we're aiming for is Monday. We're definitely late. We're definitely late, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Yes, but the only thing is...

Naamani, Mohamad:
Sorry, that's not my question. One second, we're late. So are we going to go in a cycle where they're providing feedback and then we update and it'll take forever to get approval? Can we do this in a more efficient way? Because the same team who's providing feedback is the team that will confirm, yes, we accept the feedback, the updates, and please Asma and Abdul, sorry, Abdullah or whomever from HQ will confirm.

 That's the right sequence, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Patel, Rahul:
So how can we expedite this?

Naamani, Mohamad:
We're already late. It was supposed to be yesterday. And when I talked to Khaled today, I told him, let's push for this week. Now I saw the email, it's Monday. So we don't want this to be the approval to be Friday, for example, because again, they take their sweet time. We need to be more aggressive. We play good cup, bad cup. You could say, yes, but this means it's delayed. You can come to Tara and definitely me saying because of this, it means because the problem is.

 Dating to the point everything is moving in terms of dates and the moment you tell them there's a delay, they look surprised as if you're telling them there's a whatever extraterrestrial creature coming. So the same thing with drilling. They're always complaining, but they never on calls. So can we do this in parallel with them? To get the approval on Tuesday, for example?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let's discuss this offline. It's an idea.

Patel, Rahul:
Let's not waste all the time on the call.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Hadi, let's align on it tomorrow or by Monday. We should tell Khalid, look, this is a joke at this point. We need to get to something more efficient. If everything is taking the same. You know what, the assumptions we put in addition to the five weeks are not correct. Let them take their sweet time, but we're not entertaining any more pressure from management saying we need it yesterday, because their lousy reports, the people reporting to them, take their sweet time.

 So we don't need to take the stress and no one else is taking it. It's honestly a joke. From last week or the one before, to this week, to Monday. I think we're being very nice and we're always asked why there is a delay. So let's throw this in their lap, let them have an internal discussion. Okay, that was my frustration shared with everyone, so back to you.

Roumanos, Hadi:
No, it's okay. I think we're fine. Anything else that needs to be added by anyone? I'm just conscious that we need to jump on a call with Sebastian for the CR. Okay, there are still actions to be taken here on myself and others, especially with Khaled, especially on the value realization part. That's something that's still on my list. I'll update the team once that's done. Other than that, anything else that needs to be raised by anyone?

 Otherwise we can close.

Sheth, Kunal:
How do you relate it to the BRD document as Khalid has given the timeline till yesterday, 8th of January, but today also Murugan and Abubakar has added a lot of points in the BRD document. So if we keep open then to tomorrow Friday also will start. They are adding new more questions and basically on our discussion with Hector, it's a new requirement altogether and it will take some time to address those points.

 So, how we would like to address this point?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Tomorrow, tomorrow's morning with Khaled. Exactly, same idea as before, right? We can't keep these things open.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No, no, there's a new requirement, it wasn't agreed, then we might say this is not in scope. We can tell Khaled he needs to manage Morrigan. Morrigan now, I think he saw that there are some delays anyway. So maybe he's now on a shopping spree. Let's add this or that. So we need to block this. And Tal Khaled, show us this in the scope of work. If it's not there, then we'll ask for more time and another change request.



Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah, we need to be more aggressive. OK, OK, understood. But it's good that you brought it up, Kunal. I think let's kill it before it starts breathing, that thing. Sure, sure. OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Anything else from anyone? Otherwise, we can jump on the other call. All right.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Thank you, guys.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Shall we add this? Add to the list this point of delay in BRT. Adi?

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let's have the conversation with him. Call it first, Hamad.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, but at least for us, not to forget, if Kunal didn't mention it again, let's add it as delay in BRD approval. Or if it's already under the overall design, Wave 2 design documents approval, let's add it as a note. Because we were having all of a sudden a lot of comments they've added in the last two days.

Roumanos, Hadi:
It's worth mentioning, Tara, so that at least we don't about it in our conversation with silence.

Naamani, Mohamad:
They cannot come late and share all the input in the world. No, they need to be disciplined and we're actually going to block this and report it on Tuesday that this was shared late and it's a new requirement. Honestly, this is ridiculous. So we need to be more annoying. Let Morgan block it and he'll deal with Monsuri and Co. I don't care.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Thanks, everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Bye bye.

Madhavan, Tara:
Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Bye!
