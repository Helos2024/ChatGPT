Then we'll go over the process. Then some integration data points. Then how the inventory optimization outputs will be done and how the system will then propose parameters. We'll also give you an overview of the inventory optimization models. Then we'll go into discussing service levels and risk score. And then lastly, we'll talk about the MRP type selections, the process calendar, and also what-if scenarios.\n\n So for those who attended yesterday's workshop and the one on Monday, see that it's a very similar meeting agenda, but it is now we're focusing focusing more on chemicals. So, objective of those sessions, so what we'll do, like I said, we're going to give you a walkthrough of the process and we'll demonstrate also in the solution how SAP IBP can support your business Um, as well as it's going to be an interactive session.\n\n So we're gonna also assess some of the requirements that you have, if they are a fit or if there's a gap. Now, if there's a gap, then we need to then assess how we can mitigate that gap, whether it's a change of process or there needs to be a customization. Um, yeah, lastly, Because we're implementing a new tool, we all understand that there might be a change of processes. So where we are right now, so we're conducting or holding those workshop sessions.\n\n Right now, we're conducting more than 50%, or we're at 50% of the world. More than 50% of the workshops. Before that, we've done the assess phase, so where we conducted assessments to understand more how you operate things, as well as we were getting ready to prepare the demo system. What's coming up is, obviously, we're going to finish those design workshops. Then we need to close some of the gaps that we've analyzed, complete those design documentations, and then we can start the configuration phase, realization phase.\n\n So in terms of process code, today what we'll be talking about is the inventory planning. For the last two workshops, what we've done is we've talked about the demand planning. Now we're going to gather that input from demand planning to do the inventory planning and then how the system will then propose or recommend the inventory parameters. Then once it has been approved by the inventory controller, then it's either going to go through MRP or it's going to go through IVP.\n\n Supplier planning."},{"start_time":1729750864211,"end_time":1729751060340,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Okay, so I'm gonna go through this one very quickly. The idea of this slide is just to highlight the strategic and tactical importance of inventory planning, okay? Inventory planning has to be aligned with the business goals. In this case, of course, one of the important business goals of ADNOC is to have excellent operational performance. For that, we need to have a minimum production downtime. In order to have a minimum production downtime, we need to perform the preventive corrective maintenance activities on time and with the right supplies, with the right chemicals and spare parts.\n\n For that, we need to have the right level of safety stock. But if we want to have a good operational performance, we need to achieve a good profitability and also have cost control. And for that we need to again calculate a right level for the right materials, the right safety stock. We cannot, it's an error that will cost money to overstock or stock out in some items. So that is where the tool is helping us, right?\n\n In to calculate the right safety stock so we avoid stock and we avoid overstocking unnecessary items. Then, if we complete all the points that I just listed, we can also have new objectives. For example, scalability. Of course, if we want to increase our operation of our new plans, of our new projects, new sites, happens very often at NOx, we need to have the right parts. So every time a new plant, a new equipment is installed, we will need a lot of new materials.\n\n But if we plan well, that won't be the case. And finally, another objective, it is sustainability. An efficient operation is an operation that generate less waste, okay? And that aligns also with sustainable objectives, sustainability objectives, okay? So as you can see, you can think that inventory planning is a very operational, very, yeah, short-term aspect of the business, but in reality, it's way more, complex and broad in that.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729751060340,"end_time":1729751060986,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1729751060986,"end_time":1729751260158,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"The inventory planning receive as input, well, first of all, master data that we will cover in a couple of slides, but also receive, first of all, it is the main output. It receives the forecast from the demand part. And with that, calculates the inventory policy, which are two mainly, two, not mainly, just two. Safety stock and reorder point, okay? This is done at material and location level and on a monthly basis.\n\n Of course, you might think now monthly is too frequent and that's okay. What we do on a monthly basis review exceptional cases maybe a material job in consumption and maybe a material is overstocked so we need to do something about it so the time bucket is monthly to review exceptions but in general the policies will will be defined on a quarterly basis or even even on a year basis. So this is a more detailed process flow for the entire process.\n\n And here we have the inventory planning part. The process is pretty simple. We're going to receive once the inbound planning is finished. We will receive the inputs from, here we need to correct the line, it has to go from chemical collaboration into inventory operator. But once the demand is finished, someone has to give the notice of, okay, demand is ready, and you can start running the inventory operators, review what are the scenarios, and then and generating inventory policy, that in some cases will go to S4HANA as safety stock and reorder point, and for other cases will go into the next process, which is supply planning.\n\n What defines if a material is planned directly in S4HANA just with reorder point, or instead going to and advanced supply planning or supply planning in IDP is something that we will cover during the following supply sessions.

Let's focus now on demand planning for chemicals. Once this has been done, from an inventory planning, what's going to happen, the first activity is on a quarterly basis, you review your MRP type materials. Then the inventory controller or planner will then view the final MRO average weekly rate, as the system will then propose that, will validate the data inputs.\n\n So we're going to talk about those data inputs, service levels, and forecast error. What they'll do is they'll manually then run the job for inventory planning. This is going to be done on a monthly basis. What the system will do then, once you run this job is that based on a lot of algorithms and also the way you segment your materials, it's going to recommend inventory parameters. So it will recommend your safety start, your reorder point, as well as your target inventory position.\n\n You can then, you have the options to do what if analysis. So what does that mean? Mean, what if and assets. So basically, you can create for yourself scenarios. So if you want to increase or decrease lead times, then the system will regenerate those inventory parameters. So once you're OK with a scenario, it's going to go through an approval. And then once this has been done, depending on the MRP type, the system the material will either go through reorder point planning, so it's going to go through S4 HANA and then through MRP and then create those purchase requisitions, or it will go through external planning and then it goes through SAP advanced planning to create those purchase requisitions.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729751497793,"end_time":1729751534854,"speaker":{"name":"Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"So is it necessary that all the chemicals should have Because what I understand is for onshore.

If the MRP type we maintain as external planning, which is in the case what we are talking right now, which means that we don't need to send those inventory parameters to S4.

For example, as well, if you have seasonality, you don't want to use reorder points, probably it's not going to be okay.\n\n You want to anticipate the peaks on the demand, or whatever is generating a peak, you also want to anticipate it.

So in that case, let's say the example of one consumption every three or five years is a critical, very expensive item, then we're going to use advanced supply planning.\n\n And for the other cases, we'll, with like, as I said, nuts and bolts, there's no need to complex to use like a more sophisticated tool as advanced supply planning.

What you are trying to say is that you will determine the replenishment parameters and you will push it, but that itself is not enough.

It will take the stock parameters and it will create a plant or a PR in plant one.\n\n No, we don't want that.

Sorry, Bastian was discussing just recently about the inputs and outputs that, sorry, the inputs that we want to integrate from the S4 HANA source system. Many of those inputs we are going to further transformate and to calculate some additional inputs that we are going to need on the system. So I'm going to show you, first of all, what we are trying to get from this inventory optimization part.\n\n It's the inventory policies, as you may already know. We will calculate for you the safety stock, reorder point, and here the economic order quantity indicates that we use reorder-based planning. We can calculate it also in the system because my understanding is that probably you don't have it on SAT. So additional to what Bastian was showing, probably we will need to iterate or some cost information to calculate this parameter in the cases that we use your reorder-based planning, okay?\n\n As we were discussing, there are two approaches. If we do it on IVP, it's going to be the same way. So when we use reorder-based planning, we need to use all these parameters like the economic order quantity, like the reorder point, the safety stock, and so on. But if we go to supply planning, basically the main input for us is going to be the safety stock. All the orders and the consolidation and all of that is going to be a smart decision that the algorithm is going to take for us.\n\n How? By anticipating when we have constraints, by considering the load sizes that we have as constraints, by considering capacities, and so on. So the system is going to calculate the PR's volume, basically, the size of the PR. So in that case, we would only need the safety stock, but if we use reorder-based planning, we use all the input that the system is generating in this part. Remember that we still have some sessions to go with supply planning, so most of these things are going to be addressed on those sessions.\n\n This is a formula that we usually relate safety stock or reorder point. We will see that it's more complex than this in a few slides, because we have two approaches. In one approach, we calculate directly the reorder point, and the other approach, we calculate the safety stock directly. So depending on the case, we are going to get the other one the other one as a consequence just by finding it in this formula.\n\n If we calculate the reorder point first, then we can calculate the safety stock using this formula and the other way around. Then the maximum stock definition by default, when we have reorder-based planning again, is maximum stock is equal to the reorder point plus the economic order quantity. This is what IDP offers. This is what you also have on your inventory policies. A handbook or manual or procedures.\n\n The economic order quantity is the usual formula where you have the demand, you have the affording stock, you have the purchasing cost, then you calculate what is the order size that is going to minimize the total cost. This is the book formula and we can calculate it on IVP when we follow this approach as well. Let's continue. So related to the inputs, I wanted to put this very simple schema of the supply chain network where we have your vendors and you have your plants and two different echelons.\n\n Echelons means that basically you have some plants are going to be supplying the operational sites that you have as well. So in those cases, I guess our sites that can consolidate some stock and then to reduce the lead time as well and so on, so we can push to the final operation sites. The main inputs that we are going to use is the demand rate. This is coming from the demand planning side, okay?\n\n Then the lead times is what we are discussing. It's going to be a main input. We were discussing that between internal plans, the lead time probably is going to be disregard because it's like too low, less than a week. Probably in the same day, so we are not going to consider probably between the same country, but from vendors that you can have a considerable lead time, some months, we need to consider it for sure.\n\n Sourcing quotas, this is very important. This is going to be in a statistical calculation, so whenever your operation site is supplied by two different sources, internal sources, we want to know in which percentage, historically. So that's why we are also integrating the historical movements that you have. So we can calculate this and whatever demand rate we have here, we can propagate it as well here.\n\n So if you have 100 demand rate, we are going to propagate 70 here and 70 here to calculate the proper safety stock in each case as well. So that's an important input that we are going to calculate on the system, but it's based on the S4HANA inputs. Holding inventory policies for us is first important as well to know in which cases we need to stock and in which cases we don't need to stock. This is a very, very simple example that, of course, we are going to have the vendors on the systems as locations.\n\n We need to have it. These are part of our supply chain network. But of course, we are not going to generate anything here. So by default, suppliers are not stocking. But that can happen also here. In your system, sometimes you have some materials that are going through certain plants, but that doesn't mean that they are going to be stored there. So we can put that it's not stocking. And if we have some definitions for some cases that these materials are not being stocked, then we can use this parameter to say a system, don't calculate anything here, don't generate a stock projection.\n\n Here we are not keeping stock. What else? In the demand side and supply side, lead time specifically, We want to consider this because these are the things that are going to increase the safety stock. The more variability we have, the more buffer we need to have as well to face that uncertainty. That is what we are fighting here, the uncertainty in the supply chain network. Finally, as we discussed before, the economic order quantity, but in this case, it seems that we calculated on the system.\n\n We use it to calculate the order size and the maximum inventory we needed in preordered base plan case."},{"start_time":1729754380706,"end_time":1729754382294,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"So this is."},{"start_time":1729754382294,"end_time":1729754415689,"speaker":{"name":"Ali Mohammed Ahmed (ADNOC Onshore - PD)"},"words":"Excuse me, can I ask question there?

This is our demand rate, this is our lead time and as you change the supplier, this is our variability, but target service level comes as a very strategic definition that can influence the numbers, and we will see them later with some examples that this is the case.\n\n And it's an opportunity for you to say, okay, for this one, we don't want safety stock. For this one, we have the higher safety stock and so on. This is the kind of decision that is coming on the later slides, and we will need your help there.

These are distribution probabilities that I will explain in some slides later.\n\n I hope that you have the full focus because this is like going back to college to discuss some statistics.

We have distribution types. I'm going to explain the next slide what is the distribution type in this case, but we have three ones, normal, gamma, and Poisson. Normal distribution is when you have for fast mover for continuous consumption and much stable, this is the best one. If you have variability on the demand or in the supply, where sometimes you have big peaks on demand, maybe.\n\n For us, the scenario here is that you have kind of a stable demand, but in certain locations, you have spikes, very high spikes. So in that case, when you have this kind of variability, gamma distribution is the best. And in the case that you have slow movers, this is the added value of IVB have the boson distribution. This is a distribution that is made for very occasional consumptions. But in MRO, we were discussing that it's going to be the main one, because we have consumption every two years, every five years.\n\n So even in a higher frequency, it's still low consumption. So in your case, if you have chemicals like that, that are like once a year or like twice a year, probably boson distribution is going to be the best approach. So depending on the kind kind of distribution we follow different approaches on the calculation of safety stock or reorder point. If we follow normal in gamma the best the normal approach is to calculate safety stock with this formula that we will explain in a bit and then the reorder point as a consequence with this formula here and if you follow the Poisson distribution approach then the first thing that we are going to calculate is a reorder point and then we are going to Okay, that's approach.\n\n So safety stock on the fair formula is addressed like a set factor that depends directly on the service level. So the higher the service level, the higher is going to be this factor and then we multiply this factor by the standard deviation. This is not the standard deviation of the demand or the standard deviation of the lead time, it's everything. So it's summarizing the variability that's coming from demand from lead time.\n\n In three slides later I think that I have the full expression but do know that this is an standard deviation that is considered in everything. And then below this is the reorder point, this is your safety stock and this is the demand over the lead time. So the lead time demand basically you are multiplying the expected demand that you will have during lead time by the lead time time and you get lead time demand okay.\n\n Safety stock plus the leader. And reorder point calculation is a different approach. You don't need to understand this because this is very complicated, but it's similar to the set factor that we have here. It's that based on the service level, it's going to give you directly a number that we need for safety for reorder point. This is the inverse function of the cumulative Poisson distribution. It's very mathematical.\n\n But it has sense. We are not inventing things here. And then the safety stock is going to be calculated as a consequence using the same formula. So safety stock is reordered point minus demand over delivery. Those are the two approaches. Let me show you an animation on this. So you understand how this is going to be changing if we change the service level. I'm showing you here the normal distribution.\n\n Probably for you it's going to make a lot if you have low variability. If you go to internet and you try to look for safety stock calculation, you are going to find this. This is very, very, very common and this is the book formula that we have for optimizing the safety stock level. So, what we are checking here is the man over the leader and this curve, this function is telling me what is the probability that this is going to happen.\n\n How we calculate the probability? It's because you have historical information. So if you take all your data points on the history, all your past consumptions, and you place it in a dispersion chart, you're going to get something like this. So you are going to see that this consumption is the most common one, like 10 units during the lead time is like 13%. That's by far the most common one. But if you have like seven units, that's 9%, 13 units during the lead time or 13 liters, whatever you say you need to measure, that is a lower probability, like 9% and so on.\n\n So you see that the farthest from the average, so you have same in average, but if you go like to 18, that is possible, but very unlikely, very, very unlikely. So we are assigning a very, very low probability here, okay? So the deal with all of this is that we are going to plan a demand during the lead time. That is one of the outputs we have. And the question is, how many scenarios this demand is going to cover?\n\n So imagine that we are planning to have 10 of demand during the lead time, consumption during lead time, and we are going to plan for that. So if we don't keep safety stock by default, how many scenarios this is going to cover? So this is going to cover for all the scenarios when the demand during the lead time is lower than 10. Because if it is lower than 10, we can supply, right? We can fulfill.\n\n But if it is higher than 10, then you have a stock out. So if you're planning 10 and you don't have a buffer, and the reality is that you have 12, for example, then you have a That is the problem. If we keep zero safety stock, let me show you the example. Zero safety stock, the reorder point based on the formula is the same expected demand during the lead time, 10. By default, using this distribution of probability, you will get a service level of 50 percent.\n\n Here, the service level is basically what is the probability that my demand is going to be lower than 10, the reorder point. In this case, 50 percent, this is a normal distribution. Now, what if we add three more units to this? How many cases we are going to cover by adding three units? If I add three units here in safety stock, my service level is going to be 84 percent. Three units, the reorder point is moving to 13 because of the three units, and then the probability that these 13 units are going to cover for most of the cases is going to be 84%.\n\n And if we add two more units, we go to five. Sorry, I think that we lose one slide. So I'm sorry. I hide the slide. And if we add two units more, we cover for 95% of the cases, and the other point calculated as 15 units. So this is telling you that just by adding some more units of buffer, you are able to cover for most cases. The closer you get to 100%, the more stock that you are going to need. So probably you want to stop at 99% as maximum, because if you try to cover for the 100% of the facilities, you are going to end up with a very, very high buffer that is not economically and it's not making sense from a financial perspective.\n\n This is it. I don't want to overwhelm you with the formulas, but the approach is the other way around. I just was explaining that by adding units, you get more coverage, but the approach is that first you define what's your service level. This is a strategic decision. Let me put the laser. Based on this risk level, the system is going to calculate the set factor in the formula that I told you. That is just a number.\n\n Imagine that we also calculated the variability, the standard deviation, and then the safety stock is performed in this way. So you have the set factor, the standard deviation, you get your safety stock recommendation that is five units. All based on statistics and the system is going to do it for you automatically if we provide the proper inputs.

So I was discussing with you that for the slow movers, the main drawback is that we don't have enough information to calculate a standard deviation. Indeed, a standard deviation relies on having like 30 data points. It's a rule of thumb, let's say, but statistically, you know, if you have certain data points and you standard deviation is reliable.\n\n Otherwise, it's not going to be a good number. If we don't have that, we can follow up the Poisson distribution. The good part is the Poisson distribution is an especially solution for these cases. And in this case, it's going to follow the same approach. Imagine that you have unexpected demand during the lift 1002. If you don't keep safety stock by default, your service level is going to be safety A 68 percent.\n\n It's a different distribution. So in the base case, it's going to be different as well. Then your point is true, that in this case, I'm showing it directly here, but this is calculated in IDB, depending on the service level that we are defining, and to say this log is calculated based on the formula that you have below. So if you increase to three, your service level or your coverage is going to be 86 percent of the cases, If you move to four, it's going to be 95 and so on.\n\n So this is the Poisson approach, and it's going to give you numbers just based on the service level in this case, and in this region, probably."},{"start_time":1729756479697,"end_time":1729756480082,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay?"},{"start_time":1729756480082,"end_time":1729756567938,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So if you are not having any questions, don't worry. If you have, also, we are going to continue with this topic indeed. As I said before, here are the approaches in which we select this. We base this on the map frequency. We need to address if the FMSN segmentation is going to be enough to define the frequency that we need here. If it is, we can use it. Otherwise, we can calculate a different one in the system so we can define what is going to be normal distribution, what is going to be gamma and boson.\n\n And we are going to introduce as well a new segmentation for you, that is the variability segmentation. So this variability segmentation is going to be based on the standard deviation. We are going to determine what is a low deviation, what is a high deviation, and based on that, the system is going to calculate normal or gamma. And in the case of low consumption, you will have Poisson in every case, okay, because that doesn't depend on the variability.\n\n So this is how the system is going to approach initially, the parameters and all of that, is something that we will define while configuring, while checking the resource. So we do all the fine-tuning proper for this, but that's the decision matrix that we use for determining what is going to be each case. All right, so let's go with some examples that we are preparing."},{"start_time":1729756567938,"end_time":1729756771524,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, I think for the sake of the time, I'm going to introduce the examples, but I will leave the demo and the examples for the next session. So, this will be a brief introduction of the examples that we will review in the section for 1pm. So, we're going to review three examples. All these three examples we will consider service levels of 95%, but during the demo we could eventually play a little bit with this service level increasing it or decreasing it.\n\n So for the first example, we will use a normal distribution. For this example, the average demand per month is 25 units, or let's say base unit. Why we're using this amount? Because we need the normal distribution is characterized by high consumption so of course for you considering your or your portfolio of spare parts and chemicals 25 base units per month can be a lot and that's why it falls into normal distribution.\n\n The standard deviation will be 5.2 and then the lead time is 6. Again we can play a little bit around with the lead time but this will be our first example. Then for gamma distribution which as as Hector said, is characterized by small consumptions but with intermittent peaks. So let's say you have certain chemicals that you use, I don't know, one or two times per month, but every, I don't know, every few months you get a consumption of 20.\n\n So it's low, low, high, then low, low, low, low and then high again. We will show you the chart that explains that in more detail. So for that we are going to use an average demand per month of 20 and the standard deviation of 12. As you can see the standard deviation is way higher than the normal distribution and that is exactly what characterizes the gamma distribution, a high variability. We have a small consumption followed by a peaking consumption.\n\n OK. And finally, and the lead time will be one month, but again, we can change it to try different things. And then finally, we'll review an example that we also reviewed yesterday, but it's a Poisson distribution with a very, very low consumption. So five units, sorry, one unit every five years with a lead time of nine months. We will review what is the result of IV for that. Is that clear? So this is what we're going to review in the next session.\n\n I think with that, we can leave it up to here and see each other again in what Okay, okay."},{"start_time":1729756771524,"end_time":1729756776221,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yes, if there is no question from yourself."},{"start_time":1729756776221,"end_time":1729756782093,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"One question, maybe.
