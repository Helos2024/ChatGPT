This is of course for Vivec and Adam, because here Vivec and this is Adam. So I divided in the of course, in the three waves, but the most important is the first one, right?\n\n Where we have all the massive data, attributes, non-standard planning levels, so on and so forth. So the way we should proceed is that I put the VRD, I don't know why I put VRD, it's VRD, VRD. And BRD. So the idea is to review each one of the requirements and basically find a way to configure them in AVP, right? Of course, you guys will find some limitations and that's why some of these requirements have a different color.\n\n But those one, of course, you can leave it there until we find a final solution for them. Are you seeing my screen right? If you are seeing my screen. And this is also the VRD for DRIN. I think we still need some more work on the definitions for DRIN, but for MRO and chemicals, the supply truck, I think it is pretty much defined. I mean, of course, we will find more requirements as we start loading data and showing it to to the client.\n\n That's a different story. OK. So here, this is prepared. This is pretty good.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. OK. Let's try to keep it standard as much as we can, of course. But here we have a situation. Basically, we were discussing this with Saul and Hector last week. It is the main issue of the project, at least related to MRO and chemicals, that they don't have the non-historical, non-planned preventive maintenance at the standard or the level that SAP is proposing, right?\n\n So instead of, that's why Saul created some non-standard key figures to address that part, because the standard doesn't fit. So I think what it looks like, I mean, we need to check more data, but at least with a little data we have, there's no way to create, because the initial, so I think it's good that we are all on the same page into this discussion. So you know that the standard is to create like an activity, is to integrate an activity, that activity maybe is a product and that product has a bond that will basically link all the per part requirement.\n\n At NOC, and I think as far as I know, no companies have this table well maintained. So the workaround was to integrate the historical preventive maintenance order and try to find, try to look for a pattern and replicate it to the Right? So let's say we have an order every six months. Well, we take it and we just put it every six months in the future. With the information, with the little information we have, we find out that that is not possible either.\n\n Why? Because we don't have any pattern. The orders are very intermittent. The products changes a lot. We don't see any solid how to say it, consistent pattern. Okay, so it seems like we will have to make, create two forecasts, one for corrective maintenance and one for preventive maintenance. So that's why thinking about that approach is that I will create these different figures, so two forecasts.\n\n Of course, this will have some consequences and we need to make certain decisions with this new definition for in the main one is how we're going to complete the inventory policy. Is it going to be only using the corrective maintenance or we're going to use both corrective plus preventive? But it's not a decision that will going to make without having a look at the full I'm not I'm not sure if the full set of data but at least we have more larger volume that we have now okay"},{"start_time":1734336795750,"end_time":1734336818803,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"okay so if I understood you correctly for preventive basically they are going to be two streams of demand right I mean you have focused as well as you have the maintenance plan as well right And wherever we have maintenance plan, we'll use that.

And also from admin management, they're pushing to get this data in order.

We need to define which forecast. Then the inventory policies, real deployments at the stock.

But I think it's something we have to deal with because I'm pretty sure many customers, and I hope we have many projects like this one, and we will face this situation again.\n\n So if we can come up with a comprehensive solution, I think pretty sure it's going to work for other customers in the future."},{"start_time":1734339016220,"end_time":1734339076471,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"Yeah.

We can schedule a new meeting if you guys already have made progress in that regard.\n\n And we can have a second, during this week, a second meeting like this one to discuss the main topics and come up with a final design decision.
