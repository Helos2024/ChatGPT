Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
I can move.

Sheth, Kunal:
Actually, are saying that twice a week, right? So instead of Tuesday, better to have on Monday and Wednesday. So that based on that, their input, we can also discuss in the technical clarification with it now.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Yeah. So I was thinking once we have the session today, then I will change it in the calendars, put it twice a week. Sure. Also for 30 minutes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Kunal, I don't think they'll be joining. Let me try to move this one to evening today and drop them another note asking them to join. Hopefully, we can have a discussion.

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, I think maybe time is not convenient for them. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
I was hoping if they would join, I could align on timing as well. But let me try to push this to evening today and see.

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, it has been discussed and agreed that they also to follow the planned time zone, but I don't know why they are not joining anyway.

Mudit, Khushboo (UAE):
Okay, let me try to reschedule and see. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.
