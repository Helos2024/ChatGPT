Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Good morning, hope your weekend was good last weekend of the year.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Last weekend of the year I was kind of sick so not that great, but yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good thank.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Because of the climate change, you know everybody is sick.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, it's cold, tough and flu. We are waiting for team members from drilling. Bhaya seems to be out of office. And Zayed. Both are out of office. Both are out of office. So I think we will have to reschedule this call. Until when they are out of office, if I can call them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
They are normally.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah. Is out of office.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You know their requirement or they need to be here for explaining.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this was one of the open items we discussed in the last supply planning session. Where they said that RICs and how the planning of RICs should happen. So the idea was to understand and then make it part of the supply planning as well. But Dhaya is out of office. Zayed is also out of office. So let me check when Zayed would be back. There is. I don't think there is a data by which they'll come back or just called the article here until 2nd Jan.

 Is that is out of office?

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Should I add the year to join?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Just pull in, let's try. Request to join. Yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think he's out of office only for the day 3012 to 3013.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
I don't know by mistake he has done 3013, which means he's out of office for today only. No response.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, it's still showing calling only.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
There's no response. I've added him. Let's plan it and then New Year.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Tomorrow we already have two meetings, right?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So yeah, tomorrow we have the technical. Today we have a delay meeting tomorrow morning.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
We have a share emblem empty time if you want you can. Try in the morning time. Tomorrow morning, same time and just just to make sure the eyes because he's out of his shows only one day today only.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
I think maybe you can drop a drop a message to the ANC. If we can attend tomorrow then we can schedule it tomorrow morning.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, let me do that. Let me talk to Tara and pull off plan this meeting same time tomorrow and then parallel check with the if he can join. Yeah. OK. OK, then we connect again for the meeting which we have planned. I think we'll go back to our work. Probably gives us all one more hour Regular work, thanks.

Thank you, thank you, Sadiq. Thanks Jaganath. Thank you everyone. By the way. Yeah, yeah. So what happened to that SSD? I mean the interface. Did they manage to get the approvals and then they started working on the interface or what? Yes, so we received the firewall approval on Thursday. Friday we started working on building interface. So Friday we had a couple of meetings with SAP to set up the interface.

 So we are going through the process of building the interface. Today also we have meetings to discuss the same. Hopefully by the end of the today or at most by tomorrow we should be able to conclude our interface and see if we are able to get the information. So right now approval is done and we are working on setting the interface as the activity. OK, OK. OK. Thank you, thank you.
