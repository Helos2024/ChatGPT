Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Can you see us? Yes, yes.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You, Bishir, Kai and three more people.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, Khalid.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good morning, guys. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I will check and confirm it today.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Did it shift me to where? I need a system.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I need a system.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
System means I need a screen. Shift me any room in the screen.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
OK, I mean it's OK. Just give me one hour. I will confirm you because it's booked by my project team. So I'll just check with him and I'll even confirm you whether the room is needed or not. Is that OK?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, OK. Large email.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
OK, OK, we'll do that.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
OK, you shift me.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I shift me.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
David Ford, Kirish and the The meeting started with meeting started.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
We have everyone, Namani, Pappuri, Adi, everyone on the call.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Asma is not reached yet.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
We don't have both Asma and Mama Tavakoli in office yet. So I think let's wait mainly for some time. Yeah, let's wait.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, sure.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Especially since we started yesterday, so it's part two anyway. Yeah.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
While we are here, let's use this time for our morning huddle to talk to We can see you running away, Khalid.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's the beauty of a camera.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
I know I'm not running away, I'm getting close.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So could I? Yeah, I think. Anything related to follow up or update valid on the technical actions? I think those are the they always stay behind the scenes since we only know about them. They're not part of the workshops. Whether it's a data store, it's preparation or finalization of STD actions, so on and so forth.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, good morning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Morning. Yeah, yeah.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
OK, because that's pretty nice coming right?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
She's she would come at 10. Oh OK, so do you want to still do it without asthma or invite her on that? Uh-huh. OK, you want to postpone it?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
We don't have time to when we till when we will postpone it from 12 to 1.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
The between the

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
12 to 1 we have 12 to 1230. We have weekly meeting.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Equally status. 12 to 1230 we have weekly status. Yes, that's right. And roll from

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The add-on being installed on all different machines, is that okay? I think many people that were on, or several people I saw, they had the add-on. The ones that didn't have it, is it just a hiccup, or it was just their order in the ticket, so that at least we know if there's an initial result?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so we have the list of people who have got successfully installed and some people they were part of list but it did not get installed so there are like some policy like at a PC level they are not able there was some IT issue in terms of they cannot push automatically some policy issue and only one user we've got something which we have escalated to kaiser he's not able to log in into ibp the the single sign-on is not working from him and he's not even able to log in so other than that I don't think any other issue is and now that the plugin is available on the service desk or the yeah from an approval it's there and most of the users yeah so now whoever needs this they can simply raise a request and get installed through the regular process like they get any other application.



Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, it's good to have this also as a trial so that we know what are the type of issues. As you said, sometimes it's. Yeah, updates are not pushed on someone's machine or single assigned on. Is it working? Yeah, yeah, and maybe later on it becomes part of a fake use what to do in this case or that case, correct?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So in parallel what we'll do is we'll continue working on this. This does not stop anything. All that most of the key users have access which means the workshops are being productive. Those who do not have access will continue working on either they will request through the support ticket and through the support ticket if the application is not getting installed they will also support update whatever system requirements which needs to update right for some technical reason the system is not aligning with adnox So everything will get corrected for such results.

 Right now, since we've had this manual request, we cannot go back and ask them, ask them, ask this team to do the troubleshooting. It has to through a normal ticket.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sure, sure. Datastore or anything related to the hiccup we had to continue get the data or ingesting the data?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so Datastore, I think the last update What we have is the ticket is now with the risk and compliance team, I think. So we need someone else to fix this. There is a guy.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
So we provided the mitigation plan. And yesterday he just replied. I'm just replying to him. So he's asking who is going to be the action plan owner name. He's asking the action plan owner name.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So the action plan owner name would be either me or Hadi. You and Hadi, yeah? Yeah. Hadi, can I put your name as you are the PM from action activities perspective?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's fine, Raul. OK.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And in terms of

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So we are talking about this.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I mean, just to know where we are, not in terms of only also SQL. So for example at one point for the SDD we had a concern they were concerned about the authentication method and they said yes this is compliant or not so on and so forth. For this one it's only a matter of approval or they have a concern because CIDS wasn't used before this is a bit of a new way of reading data.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Is it fine from 1230 to 1? She hardly wants to attend physically. We have a request from Asma to move this meeting. She wants to attend physically. So there is a request for us to move this meeting to a later date. Time after the weekly.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Or 1 to 1.30.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
1 to 1.30, there is the workshop. It's 1.30. 1.30, workshop is 1.30.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And just to leave the team also half an hour break, I mean for prayers, for anything just in between.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so that's what we are discussing. 12 to 12.30 we have our weekly. After 12.30 there will be a break and 1 to 1.30 we will continue this reception. Same as yesterday. All right, so just for everyone who was on the call for this meeting, they can go back to their respective activities if they want. And the PMO team and colleagues will continue on our daily huddle here. All are welcome to continue.

 I'm just letting you know if there are any other priorities you'd like to focus upon, please.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I think we just need Tara to reschedule this one, the 9 to 10 for 1 to 130.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah. So the point I was trying to tell is that from a from a SDD perspective, the only this right now is this compliance and security.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, I was giving an example for the S for the basically integration, getting the data. Are we OK? Or we also have a compliance or. Let's say more of a standards issue and not only just making sure OK, everyone checks and validates approved. I'm only trying to understand if this would become a challenge or it's only internally validated and approved. It shouldn't be an issue.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
That's my question about DS. Because from there are two things. Issue data store issue we have raised the defect and then for that defect I think it's with the again there's some compliance right so they have incident sorry yeah incident they have closed it they found out the issue they're

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
saying there is uh there is one ip it is hitting which is blocked okay I raised a ticket for it I raised a request for it to get it uh open and and the firewall team has again sent it because since that's the it's not but they have sent it again to the compliance team and testing uh uh but we already have an approval can we not give them the original I gave them I gave them but they

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
still they they send it to so what happened we started getting data and at one point something or the I mean the firewall noticed this ip and and blocked it. So it. Is that? It's hitting another IP.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
It's not the same. Why it's hitting another? I don't know that you need to ask them.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
But we have a target and so so there are two IPs on the right. We have our own IP on the both the systems. So what is this third IP we know?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Which system at least we know this IP is from

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
It's IP from the same Is it IBP IP? Is it S4 IP?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
It is IBP. So Kunal, is there on the call, Kunal?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, Rahul. There are two IPs basically.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
One is for IBP and one is for the DSA. So there is a communication between firewall. So that's why they would like to open this.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
The question I'm asking is, this new IP which was discovered, is it not part of all the IPs we have requested as part of the SDD?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See, all the IPs are mentioned in the SDD. But the earlier issue was related to the CIDS. So between CIDS and the CIDS agent, which is on the on-premise side. So that part we have opened. Now what they are looking for, between IDP and CIDS This is because of the certificate which was installed for confirming the certificate.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Is this what we're talking about?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no, that is still open. That certificate based SNC part is still open that we are collaborating with Kaiser to perform that activity. But this is other part.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Let's take a minute here because we are going I think in circle here. So can you open the SDD for the benefit of team and explain exactly which IP we are talking about now, which we did not consider to start with.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And also Kunal, to make sure we're on the same page, my understanding is we were able to establish a connection, started getting data through the integration or the extractors from S4 and then it stopped. Is that the correct explanation of what we are now, where we are now?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right, right.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Which is why we do not have the full data we were looking at and we're telling everyone just bear with us we're still getting the data right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Hadi is the project manager so he's the PMO so he's ultimately responsible for all tasks from a PMO perspective.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Just because he and in the same email I'm requesting him for this also.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
If you want to put my name you know if you want to put my name it's fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's good.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
You can put both of them like, So that. It's not like, In the meantime, can you pull up the

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Just a minute. Screen to something which is. Back to homeroom. I don't know.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I wanted to save this before I yesterday.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
In anticipation of the meeting, OK, I did changes and I just want me trying not to I think I lost it. OK, OK, let it be go to home. Are you also drawing on the whiteboard again? I started in anticipation of the meeting, but then now the meeting is not there. I'm going back to not doing a whiteboard thing and You're trying the electronic one.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think yesterday you tried it.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Did it work? Yeah, it worked. Kunal, you can share now.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I couldn't see it when I connected from HQ or on Teams.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
It told me loading whiteboard, but it didn't work. Oh, here it was working. For some reason it is not. Can you go to the diagram first? Rather than IPS. Yeah, zoom in. So initially we requested connection between CIDS and DSA servers. So we have CIDS server IPs and DSA server IPs, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right, right. All right.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Now it is between the IDP and DSA, the top arrow what we are talking about, the certificate global root.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Even though it is a certificate-based, but whenever configure the data store on CIDS side. So this is the CIDS and IBP data store we need to configure here so that IBP can talk with DSA. So now whenever he is performing that stuff and try to do the test connection then it is giving an error. So the day before yesterday when we were with Ayaz so what he has done he has opened this web proxy between IBP and DSA and that And it was perfectly working fine.

 So Khalid has raised a web proxy request between URL of IBP and the DSA of AdNoc as well as for the Buruj.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
All right. So basically, initially it was firewall request between two IPs. Now it is a web proxy request between DSA and IBP URL.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct? Correct.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And DSA to S4 is fine? No, actually, this is an RFC-based connection.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this was the point raised by Santamesh. So here, what we are doing, we are enabling the certificate-based SNC. So this part, currently, we are doing along with Mustafa and Kazer.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Moh, for your question, this is not related to the interface blocking. This is the SDD point which Kunal is mentioning. From an interface perspective, currently, the interface is down because of the top digital certificate connection you're seeing. This connection is blocking even if the connection in the bottom is open between CIDS and DSA, the top connection is blocking the bottom connection as well.



Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because in between this ad-hoc web proxy is coming. So with the help of RITM request, IaaS will open this.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
The only thing probably which is not clear is why did it work the first place. It should have stopped at the first place only, but now it is starting what we have discovered. Khalid, this reply will help us solve this incident as well, right? We want to make sure that whatever work we are doing on SDG side does not block this again, because everyone has put a lot of effort in getting this. Yeah, ask my son.



Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And learning those, so as we move from one environment to the other, we also know how to transport in a way. All of this set up to from dev to staging to products.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Kunal, one point also I just noticed we have this DSA backup servers as well like disaster recovery, right? So I hope the disaster recovery servers IP is also configured for the firewall setting because for any reason if the original server is down and it switches to the disaster recovery. It will have a different IP and Even if everything works fine, the fire will block it.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, you don't want it to be ready, but cannot communicate.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, yeah, but this part we will take care during the cut over activity because currently we are only on the non PRD.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Let me go to the even for the DS is only for production, right? Not for non PRD. Disaster recovery, correct?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This disaster recovery server is only last. A provision for the production environment.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Last steering committee meeting, SVP asked for a slide for the management. Regarding? Yeah, I'm working on this Khalid. But I just got a call from Asma that he wants it now. If you have something But we did not put any timeline. Maybe he's asking. Maybe as a

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Management meeting or something.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We can use the one from the kickoff Khalid if. Because we had one there. He wasn't in the kickoff. Until we try to.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
You tell me which one then you send me that. I'll pass it on.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
One second.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So while he's working on it, Khalid, yeah, so whatever we're doing right now, the the the non-pod systems does not have disaster recovery systems, but in the production system should have disaster recovery backup systems. I'm just letting you know, Kunal has taken note and is aware of it. Whenever we do the firewall request for production, both the regular system and disaster recovery system, both IPs should be wide listed.

 Because if that's not done, even if the disaster recovery switches, we'll not be able to utilize that disaster recovery system.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So Khalid, we will be having two requests, one is.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Guys, one second. So Hadi, I have an offline version. I think we have an online one, which is the latest. So Khalid, the idea here is, as we're talking about one slide since the Mohamed Al Amiri didn't attend, this is what we included in the kickoff, which everyone in a way is aligned on. This way, if we improve on it, because I wanted to beef up or to basically fine tune this because it refers to benefits, value drivers, which is a term used by AdNoc, etc.



Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Can you see my screen?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, yeah, I can see your screen. I know this slide, yes.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so I think for now, given that this is what's in the kickoff, everyone is with it it refers to what do you benefit and the value drivers how technology is basically this is a mix of process improvement technology and definitely data.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Do you want to improvise it a little bit and before you share just share with me the mail I will forward it to Aswan.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry can you repeat the question I'm not sure I got you.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
What I'm saying do you want to improvise a little bit of on it, let's say on a heading or something.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So he wants you to improve this slide before it can go out.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Is there an opportunity to improve it? In a little way, you can put the project title on it.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
And we extract this slide from here.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
We put the project title on the top.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And then we can share this. Of this one or it says we can refer to the name AIPO project will enable AdNoc to do one, two, three, so reword the headline. And then, yeah, I think the items within are basically valid because these are things that we worked on before. So working capital, planner, I think productivity is what they mentioned, uptime. So that's in same with what we mentioned even the efficiency of people because we'll not have unneeded approval or let's say bottlenecks etc.

 Hadi, do you know if this is the latest or not?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
The only thing I can see is it focuses only on MRO but we can also put drilling and chemicals somewhere Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can put a line which talks about not only MRO but drilling and chemicals as well so that it gives the correct chemicals as part of MRO. So we can only only put MRO and drilling.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which which line are here? And drilling process integration integration also extraction from here.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, operational efficiency also MRO process end-to-end visibility, right? Process end-to-end visibility.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You're making changes to the offline version, Hamad, because I can share this.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's mine, yeah, this is mine. Yeah, this way if you have an updated one.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Sorry, which one? On the left side, financial, yeah, within, yeah, that's an MRO end-to-end link process, so that.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And what we can say, AIPO, is it fine? Everyone knows the...

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
You put the complete at least for the, because if anybody is seeing it for the first time.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, I mean, no, yeah. Inventory. Planning and optimization. And optimization.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
AIPO. Project. AIMS. This business line, this tool and prediction tool.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Prediction tool and in the name is given this.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
I said why you using this name? It's planning to not a prediction.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
But the problem is that actually knows with the this name. We want to change.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Also, their expectation of the tool is not in terms of only having one tool from a planning perspective. Can only one tool but you cannot get away from us for the work that is happening as well yeah that is also one expectation probably we need to talk to Mohammed Abadullah and make him understand separately saying that what you've asked maybe not in front of the entire forum yeah yeah we can take him separately and make him understand why it is important so that when he talks to a larger audience he does not say that interest even in the larger audience I'll do a video, a short video.



Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Depending on which role, based on the end users. We'll fix sections of it.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
It's by roles.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
We need to think about it, but yes, I think it would.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It should be.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
But variance here means a variance of the course. As an in-process variant.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So I've just pulled them on, of course.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let's take this section.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If we update, so I just want to simplify this one so it fits or it's not that, so I'm looking at inventory and optimization, the planning and optimization project aims to streamline.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I think the overall structure.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
stocking decisions and optimize inventory level. Yeah, instead of consolidated, yes, optimize inventory levels leading to a wider open.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Is that fine?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We can leave it that long?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Can we do one thing? Yeah, do one thing.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
After the project title, yeah, after the project title, After the project, highlight it and make it unboard. After the project aims, from the project aims till the end, put it on board.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Why?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
I think this is like a summary.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The project aims to streamline stocking. So what we're trying to do is streamline stocking decision and optimize inventory levels leading to a wide array of benefits.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
We can put a title in the center and then you can put the project aims as a separate box below, a separate line.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry. There is no title. I can hear you at the same time with Khalid, so I'm not able to hear Khalid.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Can you say that again, Khalid, please? Yeah, what I'm saying is that this slide does not have a title.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Headline, right? Headline, title, it doesn't have it. So that's what I'm trying to say is if we put that after the sentence project teams in a different line.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
What I can do is, so here, I can do a small one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Make it 10.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I can call it. Yes, yes, yes, instead of benefits and value drivers. Benefits and value drivers. I can send to this.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
make it smaller is that what you're referring to yeah other way to do it is essentially whatever after project can be the entire things can be in a second row as like a small No, no, the one on top

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
aims to be a summary sentence. And then below, Hadi, any...

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
I think the way I understand is you want the first row only to be limited to projects. So that's why that's the, that becomes the title of the slide that it is.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no, it's not a title. It's not a title. It's a sentence. That's what I'm saying. It's a sentence saying we're, we're aiming to streamline stock stocking decisions, optimize inventory, leading wide array of benefits. So that's like a summary headline.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Then read, but then the way I see is that it will become probably part of another deck which is getting presented, which means the title has to only refer to a IPO project so that no, no, but then someone

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
will change it. I just want if if Mohammed Amiri is reading it or Abdullah to be self sufficient on its own.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. The things which are mentioned in this slide may give different perceptions to the users because when you are talking to these high level people if you are going to say that you are going to automation of purchase process this is not actually what you are trying to do what you are doing is you are doing automation in the replenishment don't put purchase process because then the purchase process generally is actually handled by the buyer tenders and all those sort of things so then you put that you know intelligent or whatever automation in the replenishment process replenishment is more related to because if you put purchase there are other initiatives which are first of all going on for automation of purchasing process like autonomous sourcing.

 Anyway this is one thing here also.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry but Vignesh which line or which item you are saying?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
First line automation of purchase process.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Here you are not really see if you actually try to see you are not automating the purchase process. All you you are doing is you know you are you are trying to do on time replenishment.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
OK, so this is what you can say.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Automated planning process can be better word because I'm planning. Yeah, yes, planning and replenishment. If you want to planning replacement process, yeah, planning and replenishment. You know this is the one first observation. Second, see some of the things which you are, you know, which probably can be depicted. You know improved planner productivity this is fine but you put you know reduced stock out you know these sort of things where is it where is the benefit because in improved service level reduced stock out where is all those because this is a major benefit based on the improved service level reduced inventory holding cost where That is all this mentioned.



Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Isn't it mentioned so we're saying because we're doing this, these are mentioned here working capital.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Working capital maybe you know, like what I said, you know it may be the reduced inventory cost, but do you want to say improved? See, because uptime. Improvement in uptime means it is what uptime for the equipment or the asset. Is this what? Yeah, uptime.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So making sure operations are not impacted. So you're saying, for example, improve planner productivity. We need also to add.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's fine. That's fine. See, let it be there. Improve planner productivity is fine, but you are going to present this to somebody from like Mohamad and Hamid, right? So then you put, you know, like improved service levels and reduce stockout. Uptime is more if you want to tell the...

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We can add them here.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So improve Improved.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Service.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Levels and reduce stock outs. You again. This is just a suggestion you guys.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You tell me if you have any. It's valid. Did you reduce what?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, stock outs. Yeah.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So yeah, I mean. In a way.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It is related, you know, service level means see if. Yeah service level agreed but specifically reduce stock out and improve uptime that's the same thing improve service levels improve service levels and reduce stock out probably you don't need to put it as two two points okay maybe you put

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
improved service levels and reduce stock outs improve you can put improvement on asset of time and reduce stock outs You mean instead of service level, you want to replace it with something Khalid?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no, it's okay, it's okay. Not this line.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
I was saying the improvement on uptime, you mentioned, uptime of what?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Assets. But is it assets?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So we're talking about anything related to drilling, etc. So that's the right term used in terms Sorry, can you say that again?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let us keep it like that. Yeah.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
How we can add something which is related to drilling, because most of these things like capital, improved planning. In the benefits, probably one bullet which is specific to drilling highlights the improvement of the building.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Now what you can do is you don't see what you can do is you can say that visibility into future forecast visibility of future forecast. See, I'll tell you what what I'm trying to, you know, say.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, so here we have something that touches on this, but we might need to summarize it here like AI enabled business decision and visibility on. I think this is where we can add the part related to.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Basically, strategic planning will allow you to build up a lot of different issues.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Today, you do not have any strategic planning in the process. You're right. You're exactly right, Rahul. But a person like the SVP, they say you are telling strategic because you know IPV. But for them, what will be strategic? You are saying you are means probably your five year tactical means your your duration, right? Put it in a way that they will easily understand. That's the only thing you're right, but just put it in a way.

 They will.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
They will easily understand. So so so probably five year strategic planning is something we can allow like we can put it like that.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
What you can do is improve forecast, improve, improve forecast visibility for strategic agreements. You know, negotiating strategic agreements. If you if you say like that. Then it's clear, right? Say, for example, you are giving them, you know the future forecast. Then they can, you know, go for strategic agreements based on category if they if they want something like that.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So let's not say improved because anyway the four there was nothing to start with. Now probably what we can say is.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Oh, they may have been in Excel sheet or I don't know whatever, because if you if you say are. Our forecast visibility, yeah, you know.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
For long term strategic planning, improved visibility for long term strategic planning.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Long term material forecast. And we haven't used anywhere forecast the term forecast.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yes, we've not used here.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
predictive data analysis, especially you are going to use this for your chemicals, right?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Which is a lot of chemicals. Even drilling we are creating 55 years visibility where chemicals were using tomorrow. We're creating fiber visibility, so everywhere this will drive your long term strategic planning. Now there are like, Multiple ways of doing it, but one of the immediate impact is your agreement creation process is immediately I'll come back in one minute. So, Mo, we can start with improved long-term forecast visibility.



Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, you cannot say forecast visibility.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Either you're doing forecast.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Long-term forecast planning. Long-term planning based on forecast. Improved long-term planning based on forecast. So essentially, you are improving your long-term planning, and that planning is because of forecast. Improved forecast-based long-term planning. Forecast-based long-term planning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Raoul, what you mentioned first makes sense.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Improved long-term planning based on forecast.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, we're just flipping it to be simplified, attributes-based. Any of those are too much and we can remove some of them or they find attribute based service level assignment might be too much for execs we can as long as the title the blue one is okay optimization of

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
operational cost operational efficiency reduction of operational cost risk more in the reduction of operation cost we are not doing any predictive right activation of predictive data analysis model.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
I think the predictive data analysis is the data and this model which is one of the functionalities of IVP where essentially IVP can highlight that whatever data you are importing from S4 what improvement needs to happen.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think that that's specific process is one of the that part is anyway covered in the EIML capability which we mentioned in the integration like yesterday we were discussing the automatic outlier correction that is a part of on the right side non-financial.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
There is a specific tool in IGP which focuses on data irrespective of what outlier correction what you're mentioning is part of the forecasting process, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no, which tool you're talking about?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So I'm talking about the fifth bullet here in the second slide the fifth bullet data reliability If you see. Go to the slide 2 more.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No slide 2 I'm killing.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
This is just like yeah, but the point I'm clarifying the point the data reliability piece where basically. The concerns are issue in the data in terms of semantic rules. That's the point mentioned here. This is the predictive analysis of the data.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I think if we need one slider, we need to pick if there's any relevant term and embed it here or remove some items here that might be too much, too detailed or not as interesting to execs as it's

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
The case. Yeah, basically I think what Raoul was trying to explain is that I'm sure that when you load data from S4 to IBP, before doing all the forecast and doing the analysis of any spikes, just loading just data from S4 to IBP. Will highlight that there is an error or some data needs some rework. See, there are two kinds of data, right, which we are integrating.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
One is S4 HANA, and that is master data. So for master data, it should be semantically correct. So where AIML will help us to improve our master data accuracy. But for that data, we are not predicting anything, whatever data which is coming, we are doing the fine tuning. So that is the point which I am talking about. And second is transactional data like historical data. So if there is any spike, because of any specific event or any data entry operator issue, so that will be corrected using outlier correction.

 So these are the two use cases.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Guys, let's let's go to the summary. You go into details and we just need to finalize this so. Is there any fine tuning we want to do or again? These are executives they they would like to hear the final result. So is it correction of data or is it where basically based on the data we're doing forecast so on and so forth? So and that's why I want to make sure I also so. I'm just fixing so.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
of the form of technology implementation. You want to also say one ERP and boot systems in the scope area. One year.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, it's already too crowded, but then.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
If we have to be factually correct, we need to make sure that there are two systems we are connecting to.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed over here.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But let's finish. This is how Bruges is spelled, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. B-U-R-O-U-G-E, correct. OK, do we need this part on the left?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is Khalid still with us?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm with you.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK. Would like to remove. Let's go through this quickly. Optimization of operational cost, automation of planning and replenishment process. For operational efficiency, MRO and drilling process, end-to-end visibility, attribute-based service level assignment per spare part. What is this for efficiency?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
For the first point, automation of planning and replenishment process, do you want to say automation of planning and replacement of MR on the link process so that that's what we are doing right and for the same process we are

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
creating end-to-end availability.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, do I need this one? I'll add that one. Do I need this second line? I want to pick and choose for execs.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, we're doing it but from an exit perspective service level is a good keyword so generally we keep it for xx attribute based service level yeah per square part so that's what so we are saying service levels are defined which is essentially converts into the asset of time and everything yeah okay division of predictive data analysis model this is we are doing this so this is what Kunal is saying probably it needs word saying that we are doing

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
semantic data analysis so we can say activations of semantic data analysis models rather than this is a buzzword that the execs wouldn't like what does it mean semantic data analysis model that's the least of their concern what's the outcome what does it help in adding value for so basically it helps identity identifying issues in their data.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, but this is not a value driver.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You want to flip it to say, I mean, you're maximizing the benefit of the data, not finding issues. Guys, this is more forward looking, positive looking for execs. We're not talking about project team.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
Essentially help improve their data quality.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But we're talking about reduction of operational risk. For reduction of operational risk, I mean, activation of predictive or forecast-based analysis model. That's what we probably we need to integrate the function.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
I think the predictive data analysis model more refers to the forecast based analysis then.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So I can say activation of forecast.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
And forecast is essentially predictive, right? Right, right.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But again, Rahul forecast won't come in as an operational risk because forecast anyway we are talking on medium term to long term planning.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
No, no, irrespective of planning.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Guys, guys, we have 10 minutes. Please, I just need to confirm the statements. So activation of forecast based data analysis model. Is that fine or it's wrong?

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
It's fine. This is fine.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
This is fine.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
From my side, you want to say machine learning forecast based because that becomes the that's the fact and that becomes a buzzword.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
You can put it in a separate bullet somewhere.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Maybe in the improved decision making.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, here. And ML capabilities.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Okay.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Automation of planning and replenishment replenishment. You're referring to, uh, basically processes. The problem is this is getting very packed tomorrow and drilling processes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Now this Control. Add any suggestion on making this so Khalid context and overview. It's good to keep this for the execs because some of them don't know about the project, right? I was thinking of removing it. But this is the references from the RFP, so it's good to keep them objective. Also, it doesn't hurt. Or you think we should remove it altogether, then we'll have more real estate for. Better looking.



Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
It's fine to me in case if somebody is not aware of the project it's been presented to if it's been presented to let's say you know other VPs who are not aware non-procurement VPs.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah so at ad-hoc level wide ad-hoc level it would be a good summary of things what Does it look too odd if the right side is smaller than the left side? Yes, it has to be synchronized. They both have to be the same size.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, then I have a solution.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is Hadi with us? He's here.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is there anything that you think would be, because I'm limited with real estate, and I don't want to butcher the whole thing in the interest of time, yet, okay, so one thing we could do, maybe gain a bit. A bit of space.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You can also move the benefit box a little bit.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
There is some real estate between the scope and benefit box.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, but I need to fix both of them so that they How does it look like,

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think for the purposes of what we're doing, Mohamad, it's fine. A few alignments here and there, but I can take care of this with you later on.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, but if we need to share it with Khaled and Mohamed Al-Amiri now, I think it's fine.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's good enough.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's good enough.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK. I will kill this one. Save. OK. Khaled, do you want me to send you this now by email or on Teams or what works?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Send it by email. Funny enough, last I was checking what we can add on this slide, because also we don't want to boil the ocean. These are ready terms everyone is aware of Improved forecast-based long-term planning, improved service levels and reduced knockouts, improved rush time. I think these are good. So value drivers leading to benefits. So this is what we're doing basically through the tool, yielding the following benefits.

 And the scope is to improve process technology and data preparation. Okay. I'll send you this now, Khalid. Yeah, please. Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So probably we'll have to connect to Khalid during the day for other points because we only have three minutes on this call for us to do our morning huddle with Khalid. We did cover it, I think. We talked about the most important thing, which is the interface. So that's an action. Khalid or, sorry, Hadi or Mo or anyone has any important point? Maybe we can take a minute before we switch to the, or probably we can take another five minutes at max if there are any other points where we need Khalid's urgent attention.



Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So we discussed a few points yesterday. During our huddle, Raul, but I think they might need more than a few minutes, so let's not start now, maybe during the day, since we have Khaled with us, as we grab his attention outside of these sessions.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
That would be my thought. All right, the critical one we've already spoken about the interface, so yeah, we'll continue with that.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We just sorted Khaled and I offline as you guys were doing, your fun, we were doing our fun.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
All right.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, because it was taking time.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So I thought of like, let's no, no, I agree.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
That was a good, it was a good call. Cause I'm also not sure whether I can make it to HQ today.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No issues. At least, at least we can, we can finalize this.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
I just, I just sent you a screenshot.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Uh, Yeah, one second.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let me check.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The one sentence I put it in the additional comments.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, that's fine.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
I'll just submit it.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2:
So at least this get is initiated, otherwise our project status.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no, I agree. Plus, we have the PMO discussion tomorrow.

Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1:
So ideally, we have a re-baseline plan before that session tomorrow. All right, then let's conclude our call. It's already 10, which means we need to switch to another Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do it.

Hadi Roumanos (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Do you have a minute so I can call you after this?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, I'm just fixing something. I noticed there's an animation. How did the PowerPoint or PDF?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What do they prefer?

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Probably just send it about. Yeah, send it about me in case they want. Yeah, I noticed an animation. Yeah, how they call me. I'll fix this while we're talking and then I'll send it. OK, so I'll be the team.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, thanks.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
Thank you guys.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
you Oh.
