Ok, I think that only Sahar is missing and Saul, but they are probably joining Okay, so maybe I will start. Thank you all for joining. I hope that you are starting a good week. This week we have some holidays, one holiday on Wednesday, so it's going to be better than the other ones. Well, let's review the plan.\n\n Well, as you may know, we have been facing some delays because of the closure of the design and also because of the configuration of the integration and all the things that are related to that. So last week, they had like AdNoc and KPMG, they had the Styrko session. Yeah, that it's once a month or something like that. And well, they show that delays, that for now they result on four weeks on the wave one and two weeks in the wave two.\n\n So they said very clear that the goal live is going to be on the 16th of June instead of the 19th of May. That was the first date. Yeah. This week, we just want to confirm all these and to be very, very aligned with KPMG and just to plan the 2025 trips and to ask you and to review with you like the different sessions that we want to have there. So that is our goal for this week to close these and to be very, sure about this plan, and to also communicate you and talk to you to review if you're able or not, or what are we going to do with each of the stages and the visits to ADNOC during this plan.\n\n But for you also to know, we are still, well, in the Wave 1, we are still in the configuration one configuration. We, as I can see, like taking into consideration these four weeks of delay, we should be finishing the sprint one next week, like for the third of January. And then starting the configuration sprint two. And then the configuration sprint three, like ending the whole configuration of the wave one by the 14th of February, approximately.\n\n Then we have to, of course, define when are we going to go to ATNOC and do some testing. And there is the other point that is about the testing. I don't know, Basti, if you want to share, but we are planning this."},{"start_time":1734959265744,"end_time":1734959430326,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, as I put, we couldn't have the, I moved the configuration session for tomorrow, and I want to address that point tomorrow in full detail. But the idea is to, at the end of the Spring 3 of the Wave 1 and the Wave 2, sorry, I'm going to start from scratch. So, we were working on an alternative plan to anticipate the Wave 1 drilling that is the that option is this card is we're not going to take that road route so the plan stay as it is but with the delays that rocio has just share okay have you said that so with that we have still the same dates but for the way three sorry for the spring three of the wave one in the way two we have four sessions with four weeks four for the sprint three of configuration.\n\n The idea is that we can split that sprint into two parts, two weeks for the MVP preparation for the use cases with the information they have provided. So for example, Bignesh provided some information for Saul, He's been iterating the information, going back and forth with Bigness. That's very good. So we will be able to basically prepare an MVP with the session we have so far. Same for Arun. Arun has some information.\n\n We're working with that information so we can prepare the use cases for the MVP, okay? So the idea is to have an initial user testing during the last two weeks of the spring three. So we need to get the confirmation of when this is going to happen because we need to, as you said, we need to share the delays on the plan. With that, once we define that, we're going to define the responsibles from AdNoc point of view, and we need to start involve the users.\n\n So that's why it's crucial, it's essential, be on site during those two weeks. Why? Because we're going to have those session, the user testing sessions with users. The date are not yet confirmed because as I said, we have some delays on the plan, so we need to confirm the date. But what it is for sure is that for the Spring 3, we need to work on the MVP user cases and that we will have some initial testing with users.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734959430326,"end_time":1734959637903,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Is that clear? Is it clear, like the plan and the actual status of this? OK, so maybe with this, maybe you will have some doubts. So which is the aim of this week? I mean, what can we do like for now in terms of wave one and wave two? If everything goes right, this week we shouldn't be having activities related to documentation. We shouldn't. So we can focus on two things. First of all, like progressing on the configuration and also in the integration side, we will talk something about that, but we already aligned it with Sagar, but we can focus on that, on configuration.\n\n And then we can also focus on that you are going to see probably tomorrow with Basti in the configuration meeting, that is the testing script, the test script. So this is also very, very important to the plan that Basti was mentioning because the idea of that testing, of that unit testing during the end of the configuration is to validate that MVP, I mean, to validate minimum viable product to have that very sure and to have that ready to then like putting that into also the UIT.\n\n I don't know if that's clear, but maybe this week we can focus on configuration and on the test script preparation. For this, I just wanted to share with you that here you will find in the folder of configuration in the realize, you will find this folder of unit testing. And there is the template that they suggest and that AdNoc asked for the test script. So that is the one that we are going to deliver to the UAT.\n\n But maybe we can start working with this in the unit testing and use this for the test. So here you will find that. And well, also this is, I mean, this information is not relevant for this case, but you will find some examples of other projects here. Here is the example of the demand test script. And this is the configuration. Well, I will just, at the end of this meeting, I will upload the test script, but you will find some examples also here to use as a guide.\n\n Is it clear what you think? Are you more confident with these dates? Finally, we can show that delay that we are having. Everything okay?"},{"start_time":1734959637903,"end_time":1734959679368,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Again, we will review in more detail the MVP, all that, during tomorrow's session. But I want to be clear with Vivek, with Arun, with Saul, everyone here, that the plan is clear for the following month, at least on a high level. Yeah, Tim, for me it's okay, and it's clear when Bastian explained the idea. It's clear for me, it's okay."},{"start_time":1734959679368,"end_time":1734959699662,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"Just, you know, one question, Bastian. So, if I understand So we are going to do the testing with the folks from the business, right? So with that, I just wanted to ask you, do they have access to the system?"},{"start_time":1734959699662,"end_time":1734959723286,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"That's a good point. They don't have access. They don't have users yet. It's something we need to work on, create users. But we haven't even defined who they are yet. Who's gonna be the key user. So the first thing is to define the key users and then start creating the users and all that."},{"start_time":1734959723286,"end_time":1734959862737,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Yeah, I think that is one of the prerequisites to do that. So maybe if this week we define finally when are going to be that unit testing, I will like put all the activities that we need in order to achieve that date. So definitely the user creation and the activation of the users will be one of them. But just for you to have in mind, as I'm seeing, that unit testing or that testing with users of the MVP and that is going to be at the end of January.\n\n I mean, not before. So yeah, we have some time, but yeah, it's very important. That we have this clear. But yes, good point, Vivek. Thank you. Thank you. Any other doubt or any other comment? No? OK. OK, so as I was saying, the main activities for this week will be the configuration. On the script preparation. And then regarding to the configuration, we were seeing there with Sagar, and we are going to have another session tomorrow, that we have some definitions that we can do before having technical sessions with them to close some of the sources of the data and to close some technical definitions.\n\n So we will be focusing on that from the integration side and also the configuration of the DSA and the CIDS stuff. I don't know if you want to review something else. Here we have the task of the tie-in process definition. As I understood, Today Raul was going to work on this, and then maybe tomorrow he will ask us to review it."},{"start_time":1734959862737,"end_time":1734959882971,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"I'm not sure. No, no, no. It's finished. He already sent the information. So we have processing definitions are done. I think we need to add documentation.

Yes, yes, yes."},{"start_time":1734959937764,"end_time":1734959946721,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"So for demand, I think you need to just add a few examples with respect to the file."},{"start_time":1734959946721,"end_time":1734959977807,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"And for supply, I think it's totally incompatible.

And the configuration is, I think it's a different point, you can get rid of the configuration on there."},{"start_time":1734959977807,"end_time":1734960018176,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Okay, so this is the focus like for today. I don't want to mess, okay. I think that we are done with this. Okay, so here we have all covered. Then this is also covered with Sagar.

I mean, here in the general folder, then management, and then project plan. And the one is the high-level project plan, this one. Yeah, and there you will see activities as account in high-level with But yeah, it's still not definite that you understood me.\n\n But yeah, it's there. Any other comment team or any doubt? So you can start maybe, Saul, Ferma, well, Besides the configuration, you can also check this script before tomorrow's session. Well, the strategy that we will get. I mean, the script has to be this one because I think that they are going to track the testing in ALM. So they need this format. Of course, there are some columns that there will not be defined yet as this test script title.\n\n I mean, that's not necessary, but we can start using this format so then we don't have to repeat tasks when the time comes."},{"start_time":1734960222511,"end_time":1734960226443,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"You mean for the MVP, for the test script?"},{"start_time":1734960226443,"end_time":1734960230375,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Yeah, I think that we should use this format."},{"start_time":1734960230375,"end_time":1734960231248,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"start_time":1734960232055,"end_time":1734960238403,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Yeah, just don't duplicate tasks when you need to do the UID script.
