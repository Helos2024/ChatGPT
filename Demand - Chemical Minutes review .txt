OK. Hopefully in five minutes, we'll start back. I'll ping you. Just be on the call. I'll call you. Fine, fine, fine. OK. You you Yeah. This is the plan. So we've discussed about this three chemical. Let's look at what recessions in the week of 11th which is week of 11th is this 12th possibly 12th. Chemicals. I think this makes sense.\n\n So we need you. We are actively in the discussions. So what we've done is, the demand planning that was on 21st. You've taken out? It's moved. So entire demand discussion happens at once? Entire discussion for drilling, demand, supply. Because there is no inventory. I mean that's one session, two sessions, two days, four sessions per week. So. We were aligned internally. Yeah. And they also aligned the idea of moving to E for the next week.\n\n Okay. Demo is not necessary. I still want to have those discussions because we will use the first one. But we still need to use one of these. Yeah, one of the two. So we call it, so we will have four sessions. If we are not able to utilize the third, then we'll just leave it. And if we are done with three, which is when one more is using it. So let's continue with the original plan. We had four sessions.\n\n We'll continue with the four sessions. We'll start with, so we don't want to say demand or supply. We said drilling. And the drilling, we'll start with the demo, whatever they wanted. And then we'll continue, including whatever we want to discuss, we confirm on demand. Probably we'll give an overview. And then we'll finish the entire drilling, demand, supply, and everything. We are trying to boost this on Wednesday, hopefully.\n\n We have more time because we are having these new guys to work on the library. Fabio De Caruno there will be working this week, and if we have some days on Wednesday, we'll get him on Wednesday. You guys are okay with running, like, oh, back to that. Because it's a drilling, so we can run it on Wednesday. It's the same topic, we don't need to drill. It's the same day, so we don't need to Yes, yes, yes, I agree.\n\n And then this one also. Is this technical? Technical, I think we'll continue with this session. Yeah, yeah, we need to push it after this one. We've not discussed anything on Friday maybe? Friday is not possible because they don't have people on Friday. But that's the implication for Burbidge. For Burbidge, but then Burbidge will also be required. So in general, they don't want us to plan anything.\n\n Yeah, you should have a screen. May I deny that? In general, I can take one time exception for this. But I'm OK with having this one decision whenever it is planned. Let's continue. Utilize this time for technical discussion. So anyways, we are not following the agenda. We are continuing with what we've been doing in the last session, right? So we can utilize the sessions the way it is. Continue our technical discussion.\n\n Because most of the stakeholders would be gone. And then if required, we can have one more technical session after this, but only for drilling. Okay, so see anyways here, we'll get to know tool much better, like we are talking about AI and application, what are data. So if you remember in the last session, okay, we're talking about drilling. So we'll get to know the tool of drilling much better, even before we get into this discussion, where the data lies and all.\n\n Let's try to do this drilling discussion, I feel. We'll go through this. And if we need, again, technical discussion on drilling, we can plan a separate session. Because anyway, we wanted to have this workshops continue for every two to every week, right? So we can then make drilling part of that discussion, two workshops every week. We'll make sure all of the discussions are separate. Does that work?\n\n Or do you want me to take it out? It's more for a time, see that we write course one and two. It's fine. It makes sense what you're saying, it's just that we wanted to do a better demonstration of the whole work. Okay, so you want to have, I'll take this out, no problem. If you want to put more time here and here, I can take this one out because this is not impacting any of this activity. And anyways, we plan to have continuous technical sessions throughout the project, which means we can use, we have more time for technical discussion.\n\n Yeah, this was initially thinking that maybe we wanted to stay, but So I am planning this now, so Wednesday, Thursday, back to back two sessions. Okay, and then next week, Tuesday, we will have one session. All I need to do is check my Diwali calendar, because I'm taking off for Diwali. Yeah, a lot of people from India would not be available for Diwali holidays. Yeah, so let me check that. You're joining us for the dinner.\n\n Can I miss taking this? It's people, right? It's free food. Just say yes. The first day of Diwali. So there must be appetizers, right? No, no, no, of abnormal stakeholders here will also be, you know, a lot of Indian companies here, right? So basically Diwali is for five days. The 31st is like the main day. 31st is the main day, then However. Then. Saturday, Sunday, so it goes from Thursday. So so there is something on Wednesday, but then there are like, No.\n\n It is a five day festival, five or seven days, but then the main day is the one which is on 31st. Generally the way we happen is we work before this, but after this probably it's Thursday, Saturday and Monday. So those are the things days followed by so Monday will be able to Tuesday will be able to connect again. Okay. What's the proposal? Yeah, let me share my screen. Sorry. I just checked. The bike Mike Mike Mike.\n\n Which one is Mike this? I can't hear you. Yeah, you can hear me, but we cannot take you on the US. We're still talking from my laptop, so we would like to utilize the mics of the other mic. Connect."},{"start_time":1729515081582,"end_time":1729515199454,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Can you hear us? Let me reduce the volume. Rusty, you hear us? Yes. Okay. I'm alone. Because then these will also change. But this is the proposal from my side. We want to do Tuesday and Wednesday, considering Thursday is the holiday for India. So people from AdNoc will not be available, but people from your team also will not be available from India. And then I also will not be available. So let's plan to do this Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n And I'll take the delay session off. So that gives us more time. We're all aligned on this, right? Yeah. So what time do you think is best? Tuesday, Wednesday, the one highlighted. So we move one day before fasting. So I got an input that you wanted to plan Wednesday, 30th October, and Thursday, 31st October. But Thursday, 31st October is Diwali, which means all of us would not be available on 31st.\n\n Try to finish it by 31st October, which means that we need to do it Tuesday, Wednesday, 29th and 30th. They also want to put one additional session. The first one is going to be the demo, basically. So what we are planning to do. And then continue with the session, but you still have one more. So I am just saying that we already had four session planned. Let's continue with the fourth session. We may end up not using one of the sessions, which is fine.\n\n But I don't want to reduce the number and then later we need to have a separate session."},{"start_time":1729515199454,"end_time":1729515207047,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"But can you name it, like, based on, I think, what they are? So the first two, for me, are demand, right?"},{"start_time":1729515207047,"end_time":1729515234406,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"So we have four sessions for drilling. And drilling, we'll say that we'll cover entire drilling demand, inventory, supply, whatever it is related to drilling from an IDP, we'll cover in those four sessions. So now, how we want to split it in those four sessions, Two demands and two supply. There is no inventory here. And there is no demand, there is only supply. Demand is only an input, so it's part of the inputs.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729515234406,"end_time":1729515238613,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Still, we need to understand where is the input coming from"},{"start_time":1729515238613,"end_time":1729515333004,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Yes, so that's why that's one session we said we will have, which is demand, which specifically focuses on what is the demand. Hector, I think it's better we have the demand session very you want to keep the name but yeah yeah because but it's one of the slides yeah but it's similar to what we did for chemicals right it's just a little intention to understand we we cannot assume we know no the demand is to separate I mean but we have the session yeah let's have the session yeah we'll just call everything everything really and we can discuss everything.\n\n Yes, we need to have a clear identification of where from where we are getting the data. It can be it can be a sort of presentation if you feel, but it is as good as chemicals where we have an external input. Now we may not have consumption history, which means there is no forecasting and demand is essentially capturing as input from whatever third party I completely agree. The point is, I think that if we focus on the amount of training that would be half an hour or an hour, so we need to focus the session.\n\n So that's the naming of the session. So essentially the two hours, because we will have overview session plus demand, which means that probably first half an hour to 45 minutes will go on overview. Then next 45 minutes to one hour will go on demand. If we have time, we can start supplying the same distribution. If we don't, then we'll continue to supply the next distribution."},{"start_time":1729515333012,"end_time":1729515346907,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"But the point is that we still need to present what we need or how it is the IVP structure and then understand what is what they have.

So we will have one demand, three supply sessions the way we originally had. The demand session will have the overview of IVP and continue the demand discussion. We'll continue in the three supply sessions. Where we talk more about from a delaying perspective is more supply and then we don't have any inventory for delaying is what we are understanding, correct? Okay, we all agree with. So this is the plan we are all agreeing to, should I go ahead and share it with all the PMO team?\n\n But you need to plan for all next workshops as well. Yeah, so then the next workshop is MRO. No, the ones below in purple. The purple are already considered. You can't do it on 5th, 6th, 7th. In November. So, I will just share this, I will not share this. Okay, we can agree on when do you want to do it. So, we already agreed, right? Tuesday, 29th, 30th. All the files are already collected. When do you do this?\n\n These are the only copies. No, this is maintenance and EPC, MRO and EPC. This we are already doing supply and supply. No, no, no, supply.

We discussed chemicals. First three are still pending. So anyways, we were planning till in the week of this 12th November, right? So we'll continue in the week of 12th November. But you changed the dates. Yeah, I need to change the dates. So this will. Essentially, I'll copy this again. So we need this three sessions to be planned, right? This will be your 11. Open the calendar.\n\n Yeah, so I'll go back to our original. Additional sessions for till 14th November Thursday. Which means that this get planned. On 12th you already have. Yeah, it's equal to this plus two 14th 14th. Is equal. Look, let me change it to 14 strictly. 1414 and then Let's go to next week. Monday of next week. Three sessions. This is a placeholder. We might not need it. Yeah, but just schedule it. So do you still want to do it?\n\n Like I like the idea, but then because we're pushing drilling to the drilling discussion. We have one session moving to the next week. Do we still do the billing only demand and somebody this week? If we take this one out, because what we've done is we have one session we are pushing from this week to the next week, which is causing one of the session to fall out. You can do the overview on Wednesday as planned.\n\n So we already have a- We are putting all our guys to work on this and The only issue now, Rahul, is one workbook will go into next week then. But it's fine, because the week was off, they should also understand. Only one day over plan we're going, right? I'm just trying to see if we can manage, we should, if we cannot, then we cannot. But this is a placeholder, so it's fine. Considering we're taking one inventory, I think we will end up using that placeholder.\n\n This will be 18th November. Yeah, but that's fine. We already started the conversation. It's not like we're starting the conference conversation the week after. It's November 6th. Yeah, this is what we're discussing. This will go to 18th then. We can move on then. I think that was always the case. We always have a session that was so. Last was mid-November. So we were finishing everything in the 14th, 11th November.\n\n Now, one session is twice a week. Yes, morning, you're right. One session will go on next week. If we need this, then we go up. If we don't need this, then we go down. Throughout last week, the performance of the PE1 system got worse and worse and worse. So, at the end, it was decided... I was talking to someone else. No, yeah, I think so. Sorry. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, so is this look OK for you?\n\n Yeah, but can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, we can hear you."},{"start_time":1729515675589,"end_time":1729515706937,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Could you please add the technical session as well?

But people are not available, right? Gone. So we either we do it. This is the 23rd. Technical. No, no, no, no 31st. It cannot happen in next week. It goes to Monday. Uh, yeah. So this is what I can do about the technical workshop. Because the, uh, Then I said Thursday onwards there is Diwali. The next week they are not available. Which means it goes in the next week, 11th week, Monday. Friday is also not an option.\n\n But technically on early Friday you can do it. Or check with Khalid. You'll have to push it through late, I guess. Check with Khalid if it's Friday. Friday doesn't work. Friday we have Diwali. Diwali is not concerned. Let's push it. So it goes to the next week, but next week anyways, we don't have AdNoc. Why in the week before we don't have AdNoc? There is an exhibition in Abu Dhabi. There is an exhibition.\n\n I think that exhibition in Abu Dhabi, most of the AdNoc employees will be part of that. But I need to check with the technical team over there. Check here. Yeah. I think they will be. If the technical team is the host, Hello. Hello. If you want to do a technical workshop, you can do it. If you want to do a technical workshop, you can do it. If you want to do a business workshop, you can do it. We were saying the same thing for DigiCorp today, so we went to that.\n\n I don't know if it's valid. No, we are working on it, but we are not sure how it will be in the next week. We are still on the stage Everything drilling will get completed next week. If there is a back-to-back session, we will finish it with the drilling demo on the supply plan. Which means, on Tuesday 29th and Wednesday 30th, the drilling will not take place in 2 days. 4 sessions, 2 hours, 4-4 hours.\n\n So, 8 hours of drilling discussion will be done. Then, on 30th... Yes, so today, today, today I did the supply. The only problem is our team didn't have anyone's plan next week which means this workshop would be online. Coming back in the following week I don't know, I am curious because it looks like everything is separated In 4th November, I am not planning the workshop because the stay will be cancelled then we will come back on Monday 11th November I will do a technical workshop in 4th November and then supply planning will start on Tuesday 12th November In this whole planning we are not changing the time.\n\n We are doing it ahead of time. Our original plan was to finish it by 14th November. Because of this one week's planning difference, we are trying to finish We will have the technical workshop on Tuesday, Monday of the following week. Monday of Tuesday of the following week. In the week of edit, we can still have technical workshop. This one will not be available, which means, actually, The technical workshop for drilling would be Tuesday of the following week, 4th.\n\n I don't see any. So it's going to be if we have another since. I'm saying in our side. So technical workshop for goes to 5th. So Tuesday, 5th November becomes a technical workshop. You can do it. Yeah, they're saying technical can be done. But then you're going to do it before the session. After the session? After.

So that will provide targeted based upon our plan on updating the process maps. 25th. 25th. October 20, 2024. In process. Chemicals initial input demand annual changes initial demand input annual and changes okay design medium to be considered for design input to be considered for design kpmg and this is closed then input refining replacement based on I'm not to say email design.\n\n Actually this is the input which we need to refer in the supply plan. This is not a correct statement. No, no actually this was asked by Murugan only to emerge to send email but then this is part of supply planning this no no subsequently we will use this so maybe in the remarks you can mention and I think that you already mentioned planning session for chemicals medium apmg in process status is this correct status to be updated based on discussion and supply learning sessions this is okay Hector so basically replacement based on historical data levels are set for six month rolling rolling for next quarter based on requirement call orders are issued based on rolling plan liquid chemicals for direct delivery and storage tank based on based on quarterly bulk chemicals replacement based on levels in weather that we should capture annual demand and use the same for reviews.\n\n So the supply planning happens separately for chemicals versus, sorry, bulk chemical versus liquid chemicals. Liquid chemicals go directly to the plant where there is storage tank and the bulk one goes to the warehouse and from warehouse it goes to the consumption point. So that's why I said this needs to be discussed in supply planning for chemicals and and I would recommend that you guys are looking at this sheet when we are having a having discussion like everyone please make sure that we are referring to this sheets because we are putting a lot of things in the next session so we'll have to make sure that whatever point discussed are getting address into our supply planning sessions workflow requirement design a medium priority separate session to be planned for workflows now we don't have session for workflows when do we think we can have this let's discuss now only we plan the workflow session when on so we already have this 18th november one session we want to plan one more session November for workloads.\n\n Or we plan it on 19th November. Considering we'll have 18th November, yes, supply MRO. 19th Tuesday is fine. Parallelly you can you can ask like someone from your technical team can put up a slide together for what are the functional of Workflows in IPP like how it can be done so that you can give the like standard workflow functionality PPT. What is what is the functionality so that we can discuss and then gather the requirement close it?\n\n So I'm plotting planning 19th, right?

I don't have any separate access. By the way, probably if we can sit for 10 minutes, probably we can figure out why it's not working for you.\n\n Okay, so the next one is a decision. There is a high-level agreement and proposed process. There is further opportunity to optimize the process by eliminating the manual step. Ad-hoc team to review and release up to the new process. This is design. Let's queue the same data as 25th. Headquarters we'll come we'll all come here only yeah okay okay we have a room on this floor a separate which we can use for tomorrow.\n\n Yeah, Khalid has shared me. I'll share with you. On the same floor. So. This is clear. This becomes in process. No tech nickel. What can we do on that one? Because it doesn't seem that it's on our side. Sorry? The one before they got between the actual consumption and when they record that. Yeah. So why there is because actual goods issues captured as document date in S4, Ana. This needs to be discussed further.\n\n So he said that. So there are two dates into goods receipt. One is the goods receipt date and one is the document date. And document it is what they are using to identify when the model was received. Which means if we are able to capture that information which is there, so we just need to align in technical session. Whether we have this information, close it off. There's nothing we can do. We we just need to make sure that we are looking at correct feeds on S4.\n\n That's why I put it as a technical.

Yeah so so fm so technical team can propose segmentation based on actual data format now so we already have this I can combine both of them and we can propose so it's not like this is the only classification so looking at data if you need abc and vd we can propose OK.\n\n OK.

And they need to see if there are duplicates. So today, if you remember, when you put your point that this is something like, we don't have references to it, and someone said that to go back to 15 years of history, I said, do you have 15 years of history from a life cycle of the, so he realized, and he was quiet about it.\n\n He did not reply to my question, so I did not book him for the new parts copying history. So I said that we have two problems. One is how to identify this. And for new parts, anyways, the history is of a different material. You will not be able to. Anyway, you're doing this. So why do you even want us to the chicken egg situation? I explained that the new part comes first and we need to first have material.\n\n And then the second problem is that the history cannot be copied. Because you don't have history in your system. Because you have three years of history. And then if we use that history, it will predict higher levels. You don't want to have higher levels. So I think what I feel is for new parts, you will end up with zero and one max. And once the content figures, it can be delivered manually by user.\n\n That's the process I think will lead us to our new parts. I don't think we have opportunity to We should not be doing anything for new parts. It's a waste of energy and effort. So everything by default should go to first, and then come back to IBP if they start consuming. The other option that is inside of IBP is that they use the mean time between failures. That's information that should come from the spine of the bank.\n\n The only point is that the mean time between failures is like everything but the meantime between failures is what updates the maintenance plans why we should be doing it they should be putting maintenance plan and then based upon the meantime between failures do the servicing of the machine or whatever planning maintenance planning of the machine so that before the machine fails they should be replacing the parts right that's what the entity a meantime between failure is supposed to have like if you know the failure intervals then you service it right before it fails Best practice of collaboration meeting.\n\n This is the same point. It's not possible. This is applicable for all business. I am back. Sign and this is closed. And this is the one put from operator going to be captured in functional location on this one. This is design. This is. Medium this would be considered as input this is closed final operation demandless commission operation operations team operations operations team design this will be considered kpmg closed disagreement should not be done and ad-hoc between different material the expectation is only for same physical model with different packs size with each packs and different model code all these models are different this is the input closed okay we're good with this we have reviewed all our open points it's a decision they've decided They don't want to use disaggregation.\n\n Because it's a functionality we are talking about. It's not an input that this is how we want this. It's a functionality. Yeah. OK. So we have 15 minutes. Do you have the PDF there in the folder? I will use this and send it across the minutes.
