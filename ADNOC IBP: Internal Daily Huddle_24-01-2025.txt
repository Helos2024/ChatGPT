Roumanos, Hadi:
So I suggest we give a minute for Raoul and possibly Rosio to join, and then we'll start. I think Mohammed won't be able to join as a conflict, but at least let's Let's have Raoul. Let me see if I can pull him in.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hey, Raoul.

Roumanos, Hadi:
We won't have Nemanja as part of this call. This calling there are three people from adnok calling me parallelly I'll quickly jump back on this well that was half a sentence but good enough I'd rather have raul here so let's give him a few minutes and then And then I'll start.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Guys, until Raoul comes back so that we don't waste everybody's time, the three items I wanted to cover were the end-user trainings, and that's something that we need to align on for our previous discussion, Nikita. Any preparations that we need before next week, so that in case we've forgotten something, any emails that need to go out, anything that needs to be done with Khaled, we take note of it.

 Obviously the last point that I wanted to discuss is the email from Murugan that he just shared, and that's pertaining to our discussion that we were having yesterday for whoever was part of that discussion. So also it'll be a way to discuss how we move forward on this. Now it's official, so that's a good thing, but at least we need to be aligned on how to treat this. So aside from these three points, is there anything that anyone here needs to bring up another point from just regarding those two points you are asking Hadi or regarding other points no no so for this for those points I

Bastian Osorio:
want Raul to be part of the discussion before we start tackling them I want to see if there's anything else that anyone wants to add yeah regarding the the data store the are not working. Sagar informed us that the problem is that AdNoc is not following the steps advised, given by SAP. So that's why we haven't been able to fix this issue. So, OK, they haven't been following the steps.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Who's our main point of contact in AdNoc to make sure they do follow the steps? Hi, sir. Okay, has anyone tried to reach out to Kaiser today?

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, Hadi, I have an update on this. So in our technical call, so Kaiser was also joined along with Khalid. So Kaiser confirmed that 3pm today, he will set up a call with SAP ECS team to perform the steps which was suggested by SAP on IBP data store. Are we part of this call? Yeah. Send an invite and Sagar from our team he will join with the ECS team and he will guide to the other team to perform the steps.



Roumanos, Hadi:
Let's keep it as a risk for now Tara in your sheet. Just add as a title data store not working. Let's get an update from Kunal post I guess 4 pm if it's an hour call to see whether this is resolved or there's some other issue that out during that call. Does that sound fair?

Madhavan, Tara:
I will add.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Kunal, you let us know.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Sebastian, is anyone from your team part? I think Sagar, you said Kunal would be part of this call. Is that it?

Sheth, Kunal:
Yeah, it is more of a technical team. So Sagar from GoSCM will join and maybe Reynaldo and Kajar and Mustafa from AdDoc.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Fine.

Roumanos, Hadi:
We don't have Sagar here, I don't think. So let's just please get an update. Time this afternoon after the call to see if this is closed or not.

Sheth, Kunal:
If not, then we'll figure out what to do.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Yeah, I'll give an update to Tara whether it is done or not yet. Sure.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Noted. Anything else, Sebastian, from your side?

Bastian Osorio:
Nothing from my end. That's the main thing. If we manage to solve this, I will be.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Don't worry. OK. Bishir, I know you had your hand up.

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
Anything on your end? Yeah, Hadi, just I want an update on the confirmation of the removal of LNS from the scope.

Roumanos, Hadi:
We agreed that there needs to be a discussion with us not to confirm this. Has anyone had this conversation?

Daboul, Bisher (UAE):
I think we agreed, as far as I can remember, is that since Awadallah said it on the day, email needs to come out of PMO, just confirming the stuff.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I'll take care of it. This is on me. Okay, this is on us. I'll update you once I get that confirmation from them. Okay, thank you. Anything else from anyone? Okay, I'm in between minds if we stay without Raoul, but that's not going to be productive. Or if we push the call until 2.30, hoping that he might be available then. Does anyone have any conflicts at 2.30.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let's try to reconvene then.

Roumanos, Hadi:
If we fail, then I'll have a discussion with Raoul and then I'll update everyone. But let's for now push this until 2.30, please. Thanks, guys. Bye. Thank you. Thank you.

Naamani, Mohamad:
you Hi everyone.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Hi Mohammed, we pushed for now so that Raoul can join. I think he was busy with with our login and call.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So you didn't push just so that I'll join.

Roumanos, Hadi:
I was hoping you wouldn't be able to, but we can't have I know, yeah, thank you. That's the spirit. We did cover some other points that didn't need Raoul. But for the few pending ones... Let's stop this because half of the team will be scared.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I think they already are at this point.

Roumanos, Hadi:
They're still wondering why we haven't killed each other.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Look, Mo would like to comment on this.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
I do have one comment. Or actually a question to you, Mohamed.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
When is your next meeting?

Naamani, Mohamad:
My next meeting today? At 3, in 28 minutes.

Fakhouri, Mohamad:
How about we do the huddle at 3?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Thank you, Mo. That was smart. I didn't catch up, by the way. Moment he said I thought he wanted to talk but now that I mean, yes Even before he suggested the moon Sure more. I'm happy then that but I'm happy So us joining now is a bit senseless Yeah, anyway unless there is something that the team for example the change management team you want to align with them that doesn't involve Raul and The rest so maybe they can be released and then you can continue since...



Roumanos, Hadi:
No, Mohamed, the only reason we need this change management is to discuss the awareness and the memo that needs to go out. No, not just that.

Naamani, Mohamad:
There is also the email that Morogen sent, which was based on a fresh meeting today. So I think if there is any info that change management team should be aware of in terms of change of process or agreement, it's good to know. Although they don't need to act until we finalize it. But from Sebastian and team's perspective, it's important that they get this info. Do you know if Raoul on that other call, maybe Hector and Bastian are already there with him?

 I'm guessing. No, I don't think so.

Roumanos, Hadi:
They were with us earlier and Raoul wasn't. So I think Raoul is either on his own or honestly, I don't know.

Naamani, Mohamad:
I think that's why only Sebastian is on the call.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Let's wait or you decide Hadi if you want to rebook or push We already pushed it once I don't want to push it again So I'd rather give Raoul a few minutes if he still can't join Then what we'll

Naamani, Mohamad:
do is meet up with Raoul independently and then pull people in as needed Yeah, if there is a way maybe on chat or something to check how long he still needs so we don't have everyone hanging like this Let

Roumanos, Hadi:
me let me try again Yeah, peace. You He's with IT testing the deployment of the Excel. So this is priority. Let me leave him be then. Carlos, let's drop.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Okay, fine. Can I suggest Hadi one thing, maybe reply to this one or on chat say, these are the points that we wanted to discuss, including this fresh thing from Morgan. This way, if we cannot talk, whomever is responsible for something, you can tag him or her to provide an answer. So we almost do this on chat instead of in person.

Roumanos, Hadi:
As soon as I'm able to connect with Raoul, we'll draft those points together and we'll reach to each person.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's fine.

Naamani, Mohamad:
We'll do this. Yeah. Mofakhoury, I'll call you separately.

Roumanos, Hadi:
There's a proposal due Monday that you need to work on. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Sorry, I dragged you again for no reason. It's the end of the week.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Always.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Thanks guys.

Roumanos, Hadi:
Thank you. And take care.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.
