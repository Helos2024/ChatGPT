We are going to be very technical here. But I think that it's important to understand what's happening behind, because when you see the demo, you are going to see just flat numbers. And you are not going to understand what's happening behind. So the reality is that on IDP, we have three different distribution types, and each one of them is a different model.\n\n And then they have two different calculation approach that we follow. So for these ones that you see here, this is more related to fast movers, maybe to regular movers as well to moderate. And the approach that we usually follow here is to calculate the safety stock automatically. And this is the traditional approach. If you follow, if you look or search on internet, this is what you're going to find.\n\n Probably you are going to find this distribution type. That's very common we will see. All over the internet. And you will see this formula for the safety stock that later we will see the complete version of this formula. And then the reorder point is going to be basically that safety stock plus the expected demand over the internet, okay? Then we have for MRO, probably we are going to follow the next one, which is the Poisson distribution that is more related to slow movers.\n\n And here what we do is to calculate directly the reorder It's a function here. You don't need to know this function. That is basically an inverse function of the cumulative distribution of Watson. And then the safety stock is calculated using the same formula that we have always between safety stock and real electronic. But we just accommodate it to activate the safety stock. So this is how IDP is going to work.\n\n We will see in which case we are going to use each one. But first of all, let's try to understand all this distribution type that we have here. So just to explain, the normal distribution is a very good example because it's easier to understand, but all the other distributions are going to work in the same way. We have here, the most important here is the demand over the lead time. Why do we talk about the demand over the lead time?\n\n Because the lead time is the exposure period in which we can have stock-outs. When you are in that time, the only thing that we can do is to wait to the next replenisher, but you cannot do much about it. So it's very important that we are prepared in that during this time, during the lead time, and we have a proper sizing of the safety scope, all right? So in this chart, what you see is here on the x-axis, you will see the demand during lead time.\n\n So during the whole lead time, that can be six months, for example, we are going to consume, I don't know, 10 units, for example, let's say. And here you have the probabilities of consuming less and consuming more. So for example, the most likely scenario is that we expected demand during the lead time scale, so you will have 14%. And if it is lower, like 7%, for example, that is about 8%. The same if it is more, like 13%, and so on.\n\n So we are calculating the different probabilities of having more or less demand. What is important to you to understand is that this scenario in which we are going to face a stock-out is if we have a demand that is higher than expected. So we have 10, for example, here. If we have 12, that is going to be a stock-out. If we have 14, that is going to be a stock-out. So that is the reality. Now, what you want to understand then is if I have this 10, and if I plan for those 10, How many cases are you going to cover?\n\n"},{"start_time":1729502411618,"end_time":1729502414074,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios) - Speaker 1"},"words":"Yeah, I'm on the way."},{"start_time":1729502414074,"end_time":1729502417512,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Hector Palacios) - Speaker 3"},"words":"I'm coming to the way.

So the question that we want to ask is if I plan this tent, how many cases are going to cover with this one tent? So if we have this and we plan no safety store, for example, by before, well, the order of the point will be 10 squared based on this formula. And by before we will cover 50% of the cases, half of the cases, because in this normal distribution, this is the same ethical.\n\n So the probability that we cover all the demands that are below 10 is 50%. Now, what's going to happen if we have, let's say, three additional units of safety stock, how many cases we are going to cover? So if we have three additional units here, we are going to cover for 84% of the cases, right? The reorder point is going to be 13, and the safety stock is three, as we said. Then if we add two more units, like having safety stock of five, the reorder point is 15, and then service level or the accumulated probability is going to be 95%.\n\n All right. So just by adding five units in this example, you are increasing the service level from 50% if you are not planning to stock to 95%. That means that you are going to cover 95% of the cases and that is going to be your service level. So I explained this thing the other way around because it's easier to understand, but the approach is the following. So we need to to specify the service level.\n\n So we say, for example, the service level is 95%. Then this set factor that is multiplying the standard deviation that we have is going to be adjusted accordingly. And it's going to tell me, OK, for this service level, we need to have a set factor of 1.65.

So you have the service level that is going to give you this factor, then you have the standard deviation of and you can calculate the stock as five units, all right? So here you have all the information related to this. You can see that the standard deviation is including more parameters. When we have the standard deviation here, we are simplifying a lot, but behind this high standard deviation, that is considering the lead time variability and the demand variability.\n\n So here you have the lead time, you have the standard deviation of the demand, you have the demand, and then you have the standard deviation of the data. So to your point, what is the problem with this approach and these functions is that we need to have the standard deviations, and we don't have enough information to get that. When we have a slow movers, like when we have MRO, we have very few data points.\n\n And the standard deviation that we can get from this information problem is going to be very unreliable. A rule of thumb is that you need to have at least certain, 30, sorry, data points to have a good standard deviation. And that's something that we can only get from fast mover or for chemicals, in this case, that are going to consume a lot every year. For MRO, it's not going to be the case. And that's why we need to follow a different approach.\n\n I just wanted to explain that this is the approach. If you want to look on internet, this is what you're going to find.

So this is how this is viewed, it's the same idea.\n\n Now, if we have the expected demand over the lead time, right? The lead time demand is two, for example. We are covering, by default, 68% of the cases. You see that it's different. In the case before, when we have zero safety stock, then we are covering 50%, but here we are already covering 68%, because the distribution probability is a different one. So if we add some more units, for example, we have one new safety stock, you cover 86, If you have two units, you are covering 95.\n\n And if you have three more units, you are going to cover 98%.

See this example what he is proposing, it's not he is proposing, it's going by the formula for a consumption pattern of a slow moving like the lead time requirement is 2 piece during the lead time the consumption is 2 piece in that case if you want to have a safety stock for it for 99% or 98% service level the safety stock is 3 which means it is more than the lead time requirement so you need to like see if you seriously want to have a 95 and above percentage service level even if it is vital For the sake of it or some practices we have been adopting that we need to have more than 98, 99 percentage.\n\n On a statistical calculation 2018, 2019 actually we were reporting service level also. We noticed that almost all of our companies were above 95 percentage for all the products I mean. We never had a stock out. Phased or documented because of non-novelty of material. Since we have slow and non-noving items. So we need to rethink do we seriously want to have 95% above service level in the formulas.\n\n Commitment to user is 99% that is a different story. In the formula do you need to put this percentage, you need to calculate because one of the good formula for sporadic demand item is partial distribution. However, it is how do you use it. If you want to have more service level, the safety will be increasing and inventory will be swelling. Or you need to make a manual decision that you will start with your minimum quantity and you may not need a safety for that.\n\n Unless until it is vital or fast move or whatever you decide. Even all the vital items are not required. Yeah, that's another story.

Burj replicate the same program in their S4 systems. From an IBP perspective, it can become a gap if both the companies are not on the same level for lead time calculation. Then for MRO, IBP will not maintain lead time as this input comes from S4 HANA. For STO between plants, no lead time parameter to be used. Between countries. These are all decisions we have discussed today that this is how it is happening.\n\n Then EOQ calculation, I'd love to provide purchasing cost and holding cost inputs for all agencies so that we can calculate EOQ in IBP. Install quantity based inventory optimization for ROP and safety stock calculations. So we need to figure out how we can get this installed quantity in IBP. Essentially, from the equipment BOM calculations, we can see, but then we'll have to look at the data and confirm if we can use this.\n\n But then this becomes one of the input for how it influences for the real-world quantum safety calculation that needs to be reviewed. As per the current practice, all methods do not need RLP in a safety star.
