Now within AdNocStock, you can have VendorStock which is in like Vendor1 and Vendor2 Stock.\n\n It's the material code for vendor 1 and vendor 2 are different. You get, even if it is lying in AdNoc inventory, because this is something they call old material or before VMI inventory, which they would like to consume first. Correct?

Alternate to so we looked at this example, right?

So a bomb would be seen, but where the inventory lies changes. Now, the MUTL codes for ADNOC were different than MUTL code for VMI different. So they have created a different set of MUTLs. If the set of MUTLs are different, even if for the vendor one, for ADNOC inventory, there is a different MUTL code, and for VMI inventory, there's a different MUTL code.\n\n So for a single vendor, material you have say four material boards now.

This is why I was thinking whether the day in the life or whatever tool, the logic of it is for them to start visualizing even if if it's not fully on the system. Okay, today, what I do on a daily or weekly basis, because some days, my topic, or whatever frequency, we say, these are the things that typically the controller will do.\n\n And this is on the system. This is, it's like to your point, what is going to be done inherited from ERP, because it could be something done already on ERP. What is something done from the system? The only way I could think of is like listing those user stories or activities in the day of someone and say Oregon and the Black people. Because we need your help to convince the users. Today, IDP can do the following.\n\n All the bundle of the functionalities, it can, and if we're talking about inventory supply, it can do the following. And then make sure sure, as you said, there's no assumption that this is done by IDP at the reality in some way. Now, that same logic would help us even what we discussed, what came alive earlier or not. The logic I discussed with Cesar, other than what would be the impact, and you're not included, or I copied, I think I copied everyone.\n\n But the point is, management is saying, what can we go like in the standoff? Finishing demand at the door by May 19th. The point is, can this make sense? What are, if today I'm telling you you'll get, just like in a car, so you'll get power windows, AC, ABS, ABS, you name it, etc. That's like, I'm simplifying it. If we're listing key things that you will get or you will not So for example, in a car, would you get a driver?\n\n No. But that's you. If we don't have a planning tool, you need to do the planning, but you'll get the plan ready. So I think to convince them, all of them are popular. And also to use that same logic in terms of what we can go live with early in this ending. We need to think, again, I'm just sharing ideas. I didn't get to the level of it that I need experts like you to share. Yes, this is what we can define.\n\n These are the key set of features. Again, I'm talking about 10, 15, 20, not hundreds, the family of it.

It's not the end, because who knows what you're going to consume on 2025 December?\n\n No one. So it's better to focus on an aggregate level. So this is a for me a matter of vision. We are planning on a long-term, medium to long-term, and for that we need overall vision of what is going to be the plan, not at a disaggregated level.
