Vivekanand Gajula:
Yeah.

Vivekanand Gajula:
Hi, Bastian, Vivek. So both me and Rahul, we are extended on an hour. It was supposed to be 30 minutes, but it's stretching a bit. Will join back once that finishes, that's OK. Yes, Sir. OK. Yeah, so I suggest not to wait on the call and I'll just open the call again as soon as we finish the other one. Yeah, sure. Alright, thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye.
