The type of communication that we're going to have in the architecture, right? So for the next slide, let me see here.

I think I prepared this because I felt during the last session it was there was a little bit of confusion and like it's understandable of how this is going to work. So this is like the high level structure. So here the squares represent master data and the circles kind of represent transactional data. So first of all, all this is happening in a location, in this case in a plant, but also we will have here I'm missing a part of the master data that we will be using, which are the vendors.\n\n But let's focus on what is going on in the plan. So if we start from right to left, we have the location, the plan, and in this plan, we have assets, equipment, and functional locations. These assets and functional locations, of course, in AVP, they will require corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance. So for that, again, this is what is happening in IVP. For that, we have master data for preventive maintenance.\n\n This preventive maintenance activity has a header, which here in gray, and it has a BOM, of course, a bill of materials that we will need to perform this activity. And we have a board, a build of resources that we also will need to perform this activity. And along with that, the BOM will require parts, right? Spare parts and also resources. We understand that we're missing some of these things, okay?\n\n We understand that in some cases, the task list, it doesn't have the parts and that's fine. We will try to figure that out. But at least at this point, we want to present what is the standard, where is, again, the best practice to build all the data model. And in case we are missing some information or the information is located somewhere else, we will try to solve that. But this is the purpose of the session, understand where is the information to build this data model, okay?\n\n So to finalize this brief introduction, We have the parts, but of course the parts are located in a location. So then we will have the location product, it's called an IVP, but in your system is very close to the MRC, for example. And then for each one of these master data, we will be able to integrate attributes that will help us aggregate the information, let's call, I don't know, cost center. I cannot think about anything else right now, but we will see them.\n\n And in case you need additional information to help you, yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course you can."},{"start_time":1729059123041,"end_time":1729059125443,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1"},"words":"No, no, no, no material."},{"start_time":1729059130820,"end_time":1729059137662,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"for example, a location product, a combination of location and products."},{"start_time":1729059142864,"end_time":1729059179271,"speaker":{"name":"Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Okay, go ahead.

So if you can see on the left side, we have all the different IVP attributes and what is the source of them, okay? Of course, for many of these attributes, we don't have a source.\n\n So the work will be be to first check if we really need the attribute.

Which establishes the relationship for parts and the different plans. Okay, so here in left side we have all the different attributes that are available in AVP and we have source in case we have it.\n\n So, the work will be first check if you need that attribute. Of course, location and product are mandatory and by standard we have the source. So, in this case it's not needed. We have the source. What we will need to check is you say if this source is fine that it will give us the right information and then check for the rest of the attributes if first of all, we need it.

This one will go here and material part number, yeah, this will go here and these are the, so please take these three fields also to your MARA.\n\n And please ensure that the vendor account group, the filter criteria ZPRI also is included. Now you will have all the data from the Mara. Now what this means? Let me tell you. What this exactly means rather than looking at it from a table perspective. If you if you look at this material, you know one of these one of Materials. Let me take you to one of these materials. For example, this material, if I go to MM03, this is a manufacturer's spare part.\n\n Manufacturer's spare part will not have too much of data. It has only this information. Now, what this is telling is, this manufacturer part number is being manufactured This is an internal number created for this manufacturing part. This is the manufacturer part, which is provided by the manufacturer. And who is the manufacturer? This guy is the manufacturer. And you still see that there is an internal material number.\n\n What this means is, I will show you here, this is a part number for slash n mm03 for this material. You see this is the main material. This is the spare part material. If you see this is this, let me put it side by side to you. You see here, this is the main material. All our main materials will start with 1, 2 series. And if you go to the purchasing tab over here, Let me just put, fine. So, if you see, this is our main material, but this is linked to the manufacturer like this.\n\n We create a manufacturer record. In this internal material number, we give the actual material, actual spare part for which this is a manufacturer part and you know this is the manufacturer and this is the manufacturer part. Why they do this? In most or many of the cases you will see that you know you will see that this material may be associated with only one manufacturer part i.e. That is 1, 2, 1, may be 2 associated with 1, 1 series.\n\n But you know there are cases where a single spare part can be manufactured by multiple manufacturers. So what we do is we create a manufacturer part profile over here. And what we do is we against like for example, it may be like this just to to you know let us take an example over here. This is the main spare part okay and what I may do is this spare part may be produced by 2 manufacturers. Assume that this is being produced by ABB and only thing is this will be 2, 1 and You see here now this may be provided by whatever GE, okay.\n\n These are two different manufacturers, you know, who are producing the same spare part. This is how it links. Now, this is of type ZRSA, the main spare part is of type ZRSA, whereas this is HERS. So, these are both HERS and they are both linked to the main material like that. And both manufacturer can No, no, let me come to that one. Yeah, so assume that I'll assume that a b b will have a manufacturer number 200001.\n\n This is the one for here. This guy, the G will have. 200024 OK, they for sure they both will have different manufacturer numbers you know there are different manufacturers even ABB China and ABB Germany will have different manufacturer numbers okay."},{"start_time":1729061679746,"end_time":1729061683829,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 5"},"words":"So what is the number starting by 21?"},{"start_time":1729061684468,"end_time":1729061784173,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1"},"words":"the 21 main number. See again let me show you this. Let us do like this. Do you see now you see the one on on this which I'm highlighting, this is my main material, that is the arrester. This is the arrester. Now, assume that this arrester is going to be produced by two different manufacturers. So what we do is, one of them is like, let me do one thing, it happens like that, let me do. Now, I'll show you.\n\n You see, this is the main material. Actually, this is actually linked to this material. In this example, you see here, this is the manufacturer part number, and you have over here who's manufacturing this, and this is the part ID. Now, there may be one more case where something similar like this will be over here, and this can also be linked know via this field which I am showing you now. You see this internal material number, this is number if you notice this and this is the same.\n\n You see here I am linking this material to the actual spare part.

As with a with a blank okay with a blank state that is ready to create we have a job which will take all the blanks and to try to create an MDBCR this is this is what technically happens so first when the AIN let me show you this I just made this for my understanding you see where is it yeah this is the way it is it it is going to happen.\n\n This is predominantly the same thing that you have shown yesterday, but these are all the things which are going to happen in the AIN. Finally, when the AIN is going to push the data, it is going to come to the SPIR. You see here, we store this in a custom table.

You see here now we have the SPER number, who is the manufacturer, manufacturer part material type, we also know the SPER currency and we also have over here if the material was created you will know for this material there was a manufacturer quantity is 1, contractor means our EPC, this recommended quantity is one and this review quantity is basically the final quantity which has been reviewed.\n\n If you see again the block diagram over here, you see this goes through an entire process. Here the manufacturer is recommending the two years spare parts. This goes to the EPC and he is also providing his information. Those are the quantity and the EPC quantity. This then comes to the project team, to the cataloging team, to the maintenance team and to the inventory team. Now, the inventory team are the final legs.\n\n Whatever quantity that they are saying, I want to place an order. Again, we have to be clear, this is not the replenishment quantity, but this is the order quantity that the inventory team says. You know, I need to, you know, procure for the two years. So, this is what will come into the table over here. Where is that table? So, this is the, this is the table, yeah, this, this quantity, reviewer quantity, this will be our quantity and POs will be placed for this quantity to the EPC contractor.\n\n So, this is the, this is the process even we can, we can check whether you know we are.

You know this EPC guy is actually buying equipment from two different manufacturers. So, what he will do is, this is the project.\n\n So, here let us assume that this is PROJ2008, this is the internal number 2008 and this is also 2008, project is 2008. Now, here he is buying, you know, from ADD he is buying, just one minute. From ABB he is buying some equipments and may be from GE he is buying another sort of equipments.

So the manufacturer, because he involved, you know, in the project state.\n\n So he will go and under this location, whatever equipments were installed, first he will make the equipments, then he will make the bomb, he will make, you know, the spare parts and also he will say, I recommend you, you know, to have say this many pieces of spare for your two year operations. This is called as an SPIR and this is called as a project and this is what shown in the table over here as two different objects.\n\n So you see there is a project and there is an SPIR.

Assume that this guy ABB has provided 1000 spares and for the 1000 spares, assume that I am after ad-hoc reviews, I will not now, you know, mix this.\n\n Now, the next step will be an ad-hoc review.

Now what I have done is I have placed a PO for the two years spare part that I want now but what you guys are coming you know you guys are here below whatever materials that that I am creating you are going to pull to the SAP to your your IDP system and the custom taste that I have over here, you are going to pull it to the IDP system.\n\n Now, what you are going to do, your job is not to place that PO, that PO will be placed by us. But I think what you are going to do is probably, you know, see currently what is happening, currently, currently, okay, when this material master is getting created now, so what they do is, the inventory team, they and maintain the replenishment parameters, like for example, they say that reorder 0.5 pieces, they have to do it.\n\n Now, what is going to happen? That will not happen in the MDM. What we are going to do? We are going to whatever material master is getting created, you will bring it to the IVP, you will get this for whatever purpose, for our purpose, we will replicate this table also.

We don't want that. So here this is not a review of how many to buy, you know, and that has already happened over here that we don't probably. This is my understanding. Anyway, business can confirm Satish or Murugan or any of those inventory guys who are there. Yeah, maintenance team will come and they'll say OK for my next two years.\n\n This is my optimal path and inventory team will you know review this as a one time for the next two years and this is where we stopped our process yesterday.

Are we checking on liters? Are we checking on kilograms or whatever unit of measure we are using? So I see that in this case, as we have many, many options, we need to define on the system probably a base unit of measure that for this spare part can be units, for this another one can be liters, for this one can be another one if you catch me.\n\n So I just want to confirm that this is going to be the case when you have the spare parts view.

Then table name and field name and attributes for module classification is to be provided. And I think Vignesh has already provided that snapshot. So those that table name and field name.\n\n So this is Vignesh already provided. Vignesh has provided the snapshot. Snap from S4 ANA. So we will consider that as a for multiple classification data. We need to have a separate discussion to agree on aggregation and disaggregation logic for and the required field this is more of a functional like when we try to set up system we need all this information but then we can have this follow-up session this does not influence the design but the influence on what all fields and how we aggregate disaggregate data technically on IPP side so I will we will have this action of follow-up discussion this.\n\n Here on equipment and functional location we agreed that we will by default extract everything. Maria has to confirm if there are any filter conditions which we need to consider to exclude certain equipments and functional locations based upon the business logic.
