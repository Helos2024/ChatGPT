Yeah, I can check, no worries. Okay, perfect. Okay, is there anything else that you want to review regarding the documentations and the deliverables? Any doubt or anything? Okay. Okay. So, I think that we deserve ‚Äì you deserve a congratulations because this week we finalized the documentation of the Wave 2, and that was also a very huge challenge considering all the comments all the interactions that we had, so thank you and congratulations.\n\n It seems like we're going to close all this design stage by 2024, so that's good. We can start working on what is important, that is the configuration on the next Well let's see what else we have here. Assess impact of changing plan for the other MRP area.

So along with that, I also sent an email to SAP asking for this so they can provide, they can give us some insights regarding what is going to be the technical impact of this kind of decision.\n\n But how long will it take? I think it's something that maybe Reynaldo and Sagar can answer. Do you believe, Sagar, that the timeline will be affected by this change, like considerably, or more or less it's going to be the same effort? I mean, of course, it's going to be more effort, but it's going to delay the integration more than that we are are already delayed or is going to be pretty much the same?\n\n"},{"start_time":1734701172824,"end_time":1734701257254,"speaker":{"name":"Sagar Vora"},"words":"Oh, no, I think it will affect the timelines because this will be a completely new change, right? So we, means the first, from ABAP front, it will take time. Also, we need to see like which all tables now we have to use. First analysis needs to be done, the tables needs to be identified. And after that, the logic needs to be provided to ABAP And then the validation, basically the unit testing and all that will be required.\n\n So timelines will be affected. So we just have to see. Currently, we have to see what election items we can do, because I think we have identified the extractors which will be where we need change. So if we are good with that, then we can start identifying the tables, like which all tables be required example in location if we are bringing MRP area so where we can like MDL view is a table so we can create a document and we can keep updating that document so when we are ready with the changes then we can share that with the app Basti, in that line, this is definitely part of the critical path.\n\n"},{"start_time":1734701257254,"end_time":1734701274964,"speaker":{"name":"Sebastian Alba"},"words":"What we should do is to confirm or look for consultants and allocate them to the project starting first week of January.
