UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, everybody. Hi. Hi, Vivek.

Rocio Minguillon:
Hi, Vashti.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How are you? Doing well, thank you.

Rocio Minguillon:
Happy New Year, Vashti.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I didn't speak with you yesterday. Happy New Year for everyone.

Bastian Osorio:
Happy birthday, Ray.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you, Basti.

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
Did you have a good time? Yeah, I went to dinner with my girlfriend. And after that, we sang Happy Birthday with my sister in my house. So that's very good. So I want to tell you guys that for the next Monday, I will take a day off for my birthday. So it's something that But I didn't know until yesterday, so I will going to request my. My my day for the next Monday. OK, next Monday.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, yeah. I think we are OK also in terms of On the project.

Rocio Minguillon:
Well, I think that the team, the other part of the team should be in a internal meeting, like something related to configuration, as I don't think that it's a coincidence that they are not here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, let's wait a couple of minutes because there are a lot of things to align. Maybe, I don't know, Ray, if you could give us the current status of the interface. Did you receive answer of the ticket or not yet?

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
I don't know. Maybe Sagar had more information about that because I think they have a meeting in the morning today.

Rocio Minguillon:
Sagar wrote me two minutes before and he put me Yeah, for you to know Ray yesterday on the huddle, I mean, hello team. Here is the rest of the team.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi Hector, Pablo, Pelayo.

Rocio Minguillon:
Hello team.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, guys. We are closing a meeting. No worry.

Rocio Minguillon:
Well, as we are going to review first this thing that I told you yesterday, just for you to know, we are working on the rebase plan because, as you know, we are delayed on the original plan, on the original dates of the configuration of each of the activities that we have, mainly because of the delay on the providing of the server and the firewall setup, but also in the approval of the different documents.

 So you know that we are delayed. So we are working on this by the end of this week, This should be approved by AdNoc, so let's not take this as definitive. But for you to know and for you to be aware and feel comfortable with, yeah, we start counting the configuration as it started while they provide the access to the firewall. So for Wave 1, we are supposed to have started the configuration two weeks ago.

 We will see if there is further delay, if the configuration of the interface is not ready by this week. If next week we are still not having the possibility to progress on the integration, then we will add delay to this. But hopefully this will be the plan. And, well, yeah, tomorrow also we are going to plan the trips with Vasti and Hector. But, well, this week we are working on this from the PMO side.

 And, well, for Wave 2, I mean, it's attached to the Wave 1, so technically we are starting the configuration next week. No, not yet. But yeah, this is how maybe it will look, the plan. But well, I will confirm you next week when we have the approval of ADNOC. I don't know if there is any doubt regarding the plan or something. There is some concerns about this, something that you want to know or you need some transparency.

 Transparency or clarity. Everything is okay? Yes? No? If we move the visit, the travel for the UAT, are we going to, do we have some space here for doing that?

Hector Palacios:
The UAT or do you mean The child that we had on the 20 of...

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, we have a space for that because we are still on that configuration sprint, yeah. And I already mentioned that yesterday to AdNoc. Also, we made it very clear in the status presentation that they had today with If you see, today they had their, let me see, today, all Tuesdays they have their status presentations with AdNoc. I don't participate in them, but I prepare the presentation.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, January.

Rocio Minguillon:
Here it is. So today they raised, or I don't know the past of that verb, but you understand. Today, they raised this point regarding the unavailability of business stakeholders for key project activities may impact timeline further. Is very clear on what did I mean with this. And it's the thing about drilling that they are not answering the points regarding the data and neither the organization of the meeting for the demo.

 So KPMG is aware of that. Yesterday, I really highlight that. And they are aware of the changes of the travel plan if they don't like solve this this week. So today in the huddle I will have a more update on this and how it went when talking with AdNoc about this. I will tell you. But yes, that risk is here. I don't know if you have any other doubts. Did I make myself clear?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. OK.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, any other like question regarding the like the whole plan? Well then regarding the documentation, I'm not sure. I don't know if you are, but I think that the the way one is already approved, like totally approved. Yeah, it is. That's nice and also the web too, they already sent the whole document. So I think that they are still waiting for some approvals, but I think that we are there. I mean, with the comments that we answered and we finished on Friday, they already sent to that.

 Yeah, so in terms of deliverables of these first phase, I think that we are finished with everything. Let me just check here if there is any pending. Well, uh, tie in. I think that we can close this because we already like deliver our partner. Hey, am I right? I mean, we gave all the

Bastian Osorio:
The information that we had and we Yeah, I will put it still as I mean, they provide some inputs, but they were very little.

Rocio Minguillon:
So. I don't know. But in terms of the deliverable, it was possible to to finish it.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, yeah, we we close it. No, no, I mean, yeah, we provide it. We provide I think. I don't was the final one.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, yes. OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, so that's in terms of that deliverables. Then, I don't know, Sagar, can you give us, like, the status of the interface configuration? That is something that has all of us very, like, anxious about. No, I think there is no progress yet.

Sagar Vora:
We are still waiting for update from SAP, but currently I'm working on the mapping sheets for the drilling MRO and chemical and I'm planning to connect after this call to see like what other connections and what will be the deliverable dates and all that.

Hector Palacios:
Sagar, did you raise the ticket with our user?

Sagar Vora:
No, no, it was raised with Pfizer's ID, so I am able to see with your ID.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, yeah, there's another one. These guys are not to be because if they have that medium priority, that doesn't reflect what we need. And they are not going to take it into consideration anytime soon. So let's wait.

Sagar Vora:
No, no, it's a high priority and even fall eyes on it. So SAP has replied they are looking into it. So most means I'm hopeful like it should. Yeah. It should be closed by tomorrow. Let's hope for the best.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, so they already updated that high priority, but we're still waiting for the answer.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, and there is anything else that we can raise that priority? I think that Pelayo already knows.

Sagar Vora:
Yeah, we have already done that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, not that one.

Rocio Minguillon:
I'm not sure you are there in the image.

Sagar Vora:
Let me check. I think that there was an email, but I can't find it. Okay, don't worry. I think you are not there. Khalid, Kaiser, Rahul, Tara, Pushpu, Kunal, they all are there.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, let's wait for that. Regarding the mapping and what you are doing, I know that we have this task regarding the technical sessions and the definitions that are still pending. But first, we wanted to focus on the things that we can define and the mapping that we can do. But I don't know if you agree Sagar, Bastian in a date for asking for these sessions. I mean, should these sessions be next week or what are we planning?



Bastian Osorio:
I requested for Sagar and Reinaldo a plan with the date and based on that we will be able to schedule the sessions. Without having the plan, is that possible?

Hector Palacios:
We raised that point and they said to us, let's use the open point sessions that we have today.

Rocio Minguillon:
And which are that open point sessions that we have?

Hector Palacios:
The ones that we are having twice a week, Tuesday, Thursday, probably you are not there because.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. It's another one.

Rocio Minguillon:
They answered that already. Okay. Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
So it's just that we are prepared and we go with Sagar to one of those meetings and we start bringing the topics.

Sagar Vora:
I am thinking like once we have the integration ready, like configuration is done, then we can load something into IBP so that we can see like how the data is and then we can have a look.

Hector Palacios:
It seems that without showing data is not the best approach we think.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
So in the best scenario, and we will see tomorrow, I think that tomorrow, Sagar and Ray will have that plan finished. But in the best scenario, I think that this will be by the end of next week. I mean, if by Friday we finish the integration, if they answer the ticket and whatever, then by the beginning of the week, you will be able to inject integrate some data, maybe by the end of the week, by Thursday, Friday, you will be able to discuss something with users.

 Do you agree with me? I mean, I imagine that. Okay. I think that you open your mic.

Sagar Vora:
Sagar, are you okay with this? Yeah. I mean, if disclosed by tomorrow, then yeah, mostly Thursday, Friday, we will have something in IPP. So if not this week, might be then next Tuesday, we will have some questions which we can discuss on.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, yeah, I meant like the next week by the end of the week. I mean, I don't think that this week we will have.

Sagar Vora:
Okay, yeah, then yeah, next week, hopefully, yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes. Okay. Okay, so we are aligned on the priorities of the integration. I don't know if there is something else. I wanted also to share that I already have the names, well, yesterday Reinaldo also told me, but Diego from PIPO confirmed me and Isabel and Fernanda are aware that they are going to help us with the ABAP. Side with the above configuration. They are already aware of that. They already have their, how you say, resource planning, how you say, the asignacion, their-.

 Allocation.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
They already have their allocation to the project by 50 percent until today. I asked them their passports and the seeing of of the documentation that AdNoc asked us for delivering the user, the sub-user. But then I need you, Vashti, Ray, Sagar, and Hector to agree on when should we start working with them and what should we start asking them. But they are already available just for you.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, that's why we need the plan.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah I'm not sure why I mean Isabel is at 50% is not at 100 maybe that's why because we were asking by a hundred but I don't know Fernanda her seniority maybe she's just junior I don't know I don't

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
know right? When is she going to start in the project this week or the next week?

Rocio Minguillon:
They are already assigned by from today they already have their 50% so it's whenever we want I mean they are assigned so We can take advantage.

Hector Palacios:
Let's put priority in the plan then, and then we can discuss together when to start working with them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, no problem. Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
To review that plan, I mean, are you going to use, should we put a 30 minutes meeting tomorrow to review that? How do we want to approach that?

Hector Palacios:
Is it feasible for you guys to have something for tomorrow or you are working on something else with higher priority now?

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
My current priority is all the extractors, so I am working on that because by tomorrow I'm going to show you guys all the ones that I have.

Rocio Minguillon:
But you already have the list of activities, right?

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
The only thing missing is the dates. Yeah, yeah. So for that, we are going to meet with Saga after this meeting to put some deadline there. Then tomorrow review with Hector and Basti.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Ah, OK.

Hector Palacios:
If you have issues with the dates, let's focus on the effort on your side. And then tomorrow maybe we can finalize the dates together. So instead of a meeting to review, it will be a work meeting.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, I didn't understand.

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, we have two things to review with Ray and Sagar. Let's put a meeting for tomorrow.

Hector Palacios:
They don't need to have it finalized, but just as a first approach. Tomorrow we can finalize on that meeting, a working session for that. Do you already have a meeting or should I? If you can schedule something, that would be great.

Rocio Minguillon:
Maybe we change the integration weekly for tomorrow instead of Thursday or not? Which one?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry?

Rocio Minguillon:
The integration weekly. We already had a meeting to talk about these kind of things with Rainer. It's on Thursday, so maybe we can move it for tomorrow. Interregion weekly, I haven't seen that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. What do you think?

Bastian Osorio:
That was the initial idea of that session. To review the plan. Yeah, can we move it for tomorrow maybe?

Rocio Minguillon:
Or we still have it on Thursday? I mean it's just the urgency is just that we have these two resources and we...

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, we can move it for tomorrow.

Hector Palacios:
Or even in the afternoon and then it's Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Well, thank you very much for the update. That's all from the interface and the integration work stream. Then regarding the other things, I know that in the configuration side, you are working on all these activities, and I think that now we can put priority on that because because we are not having to do that much stuff with documentation. I don't know. I mean, I know that in the demand, in the Wave 1 side, you're progressing, but I'm not sure in the Wave 2 if you could align the configuration tasks and the plan or how are you on that side if you need something from me to help you on the progress of this configuration plan.

 Maybe Vivek or Vasti you are like more focused on Wave 2.

Hector Palacios:
Let's close it. By the way, Rocio, we are creating one document. Next, you have the open points that are more granular, like technical. We are taking some points there, like more configuration-wise, and then we are keeping here the big ones for the daily. But the VRD one, I will take it with me. Already have some tasks, so I will check that on my side.

Rocio Minguillon:
But are you talking about Wave 2 also?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, Wave 2, Wave 1, drilling, MRO, chemicals, everything. So, I will check that and I already put that topic on my side to do that on granular level.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, yes, my question is if both of the configuration, like sprints, one of Wave 2 and Wave 1 are progressing like in the activities or if you need something from me.

Hector Palacios:
No, we are. Okay. So, if we have any stopper related to requirements and we are going to raise it here on the daily as well, but I think that many activities are more like configuration and we need to go one by one, you

Rocio Minguillon:
know. Okay, sure. Then regarding the the scripts of the unit testing that we set with KPMG that date of the 17th of January, that is next week, by the end of the next week. And I'm saying that we are okay with that because I understand that while you are doing that configuration, you are also preparing that script Am I right? The scripts for the unit testing or the MVP or however, whatever we can call it.

 The scripts, are we like progressing on that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Or not?

Saul Portillo:
Yes, we are working on that. The idea is finished this week. Ah, okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Perfectly fine.

Saul Portillo:
But we align with what we do in the first week for the MVP. What activities and what we do in the system.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, yes, yes, okay. Okay, so I will assume that this is going well. Also, KPMG asked me if in one of these dailies that we are going to have, the technical dailies that we are going to have like twice a week, if we can... Sorry, someone knocked on my door, but I think that it was a mistake. Yeah, they asked me we can show in one of the dailies that will be twice a week, so maybe next Tuesday, like one week after this, maybe we can show our progress and the format that we are using and everything just to check with them that is everything okay.

 But just for you to know, they are expecting this for the 17th. That is the day that we told them. Okay.

Hector Palacios:
They want the scripts or they want to see the configuration?

Rocio Minguillon:
No, no, no, the scripts, the scripts. Yeah, the scripts, just the scripts. Well, and then we were in a meeting with Bastian, with KPMG, where there are two other tasks that we will talk later on that. Maybe Bastian will align who is going to take this, but there are some other things where they need our help. That is a research matrix where they put all the developments that have to be done. And then a presentation regarding the requirements from AdNoc for next phases.

 But well, then we will tell you more about these and responsibilities. But yes, there is also this new task that we need to approach. Okay, is there any other point that you want to raise or discuss? Is everything clear, like the priorities, the things that are ongoing?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes? No. Not from my side.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, so thank you very much. Thank you, Rocio.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Have a nice day. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thanks.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hmm.
