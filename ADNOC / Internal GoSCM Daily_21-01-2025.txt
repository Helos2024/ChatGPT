Rocio Minguillon:
Hi, Sagar. How is the office? Good. Pretty good. A little bit lonely, but it's good.

Pelayo Fernandez:
It's raining.

Rocio Minguillon:
It's raining a lot outside. Yeah. I'm here as well. Can you hear me well?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, we can.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, cool.

Rocio Minguillon:
Are you planning to go on Friday? I mean, you're traveling this weekend, Vashti, so I don't know. Actually, first of all, we are not sure if we're going to travel.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I think KPMG is pushing for us not to be there, but I think it's a little bit... Well, we can talk about this later. But still, I'm going to travel on Monday, so...

Rocio Minguillon:
So you are going to the office on Friday?

Pelayo Fernandez:
Yeah, I think so. Because this meeting... Although now that I think I need to be on... Yeah, I don't know. I will check.

Rocio Minguillon:
But I probably will come. Okay. Nice, yes. Because if we go there, then we can have something to eat and go refund it as it's there. The the meeting of the uh all hands or I don't know which is the name but yeah if we we eat something then we can yeah the thing is I have to I'm moving to to the new flat to

Pelayo Fernandez:
a new apartment so I have to go to sign the contract on friday at 6 p.m I believe so okay so it's very close from here so maybe I can go and then just or something like that.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, OK, we will see. Hello, Tim.

Pablo Lopez:
I think I'm going this Friday to the office.

Rocio Minguillon:
That you can't, no? No, I'm going to. Ah, you're going to? Ah, nice. Why? Because of the all hands thing. Yes, I mean, you can come, of course. But if you can't, no problem. I mean, they put that. That is compulsory, but we are also meeting on other days, so it's not a problem if you don't come. I mean, you can choose, of course, we will be here, but don't feel compromised or whatever.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Yeah, it's something we need to address, Rocio, because, of course, Pablo is not living in Madrid. I know he wants to move to Madrid. We also want him moving to Madrid so we can see him more often. But then, and this is just not just for Pablo, but if he's mandatory, but he was hired as in remote job in Cadiz, then we need to find a way. I mean, for him being mandatory, I think the first thing will be that being Cadiz.



Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Or if not, it's not mandatory and if he wants to come, it's up to them, or if it's mandatory, then we have to pay for the ticket, but it's... Yes, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, so we will take...

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, we take that point. One or the other. Yeah, we take that point. I think that the answer will be the first one. That is the thing that happens in... I mean, when I lived in Cordoba, for us, I mean, we don't have office, and we don't... I mean, we can't go to Buenos Aires for El Han, so we were doing, like, something together, but if someone can't, it was not compulsory. But yeah, let us also let you know.

 But for this Friday, I mean, don't feel the pressure of coming.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
But of course, if you want to come, you are more than welcome. I'm welcome.

Pablo Lopez:
Yes, I think I will go. I'm also searching for apartments to rent but it's very difficult.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Just for a hundred euros you can stay at my place.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's very expensive.

Rocio Minguillon:
Breakfast included.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Okay, okay. It's good, it's good. Think about it now, I'm just joking.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
I'm just joking.

Pelayo Fernandez:
There's no way I'm gonna charge you a hundred. I'm gonna charge you two hundred.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, Tim. So, well, thank you all for joining. We will try to do this as fast as we can. First of all, yeah, we yesterday discussed with Hadi and Mo about the possibility of you not traveling. But, you know, I mean, I sent the guide for installing IVP. I also sent them the address. I don't know if you have any other news this morning or something that we need to know regarding the plans for next week.



Pelayo Fernandez:
Yeah, one thing that Raul mentioned is that they were planning to do something, which is I think not good, to divide the users. So in this way, we will have to have multiple meetings to address the same topics. For me, actually, this is not a problem, but that means that we will have to extend the sessions. Extend not in time, but in frequency. So, for example, we had one week for drilling sessions.

 I think maybe, sorry, for MRO sessions, MRO and then instead of just one week, we will have to have two weeks, something like that.

Rocio Minguillon:
But I don't understand. I mean, he means like to split the users, but into, for example, chemicals and MRO, like having separate...

Pelayo Fernandez:
No, no, per AGCs. So, for example, five AGCs in the first meeting and then the rest of the other five AGCs in For unit testing?

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah. But in the key users that they sent us, let me share that. I mean, wow. I think that we shouldn't accept that.

Pelayo Fernandez:
But if we don't accept that, then the alternative is to have We currently, we plan three sessions for demo planning. Then we should try to address as much as we can in one session and then replicate the session once again for another group of users, so we can do everything in one week. But it's going to be hectic. I mean, the amount of details that we will have to address in one meeting are going to be way too much.

 There's no way we're going to be able to address everything.

Rocio Minguillon:
Like, for example, we have this meeting on Tuesday. This meeting. Demand planning. Two of MRO demand planning.

Rocio Minguillon:
So these are all the users that should be there, no? Well, except of these, they really know. But all these? Or I am misunderstanding. I mean, what was our initial plan? I'm not sure what are the users, to be honest.

Pelayo Fernandez:
So I cannot say. But they plan to divide it.

Rocio Minguillon:
This is like the list of key users that they they build for the user.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I'm not sure of the user, but Hector, he mentioned two or three sessions. Two or three groups. Two sessions. In two groups.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Well, then if we can't do anything here, let's align on the huddle. Well, I don't know if you want to align on the huddle.

Pelayo Fernandez:
we think is the best idea.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rocio Minguillon:
Let's talk about that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Hector Palacios:
Reduce the session because otherwise we will be having, if they cannot reduce the users, I don't see the benefit. The only benefit I was talking about is like if you can reduce the users, but if you cannot, it's better to have them in the same session than to have them in separate sessions, but at least they can be

Rocio Minguillon:
aligned. Is this to many users?

Pelayo Fernandez:
Many users will have a passive interaction, passive, I don't know.

Hector Palacios:
But then let's be clear that we need two more weeks then.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I mean, we need to, I understand that our disadvantages of any of the options. I'm just stating the points, but I'm not saying...

Rocio Minguillon:
No, I think that... I think that if we choose to have separate sessions between the SDGs for this instance, like the unit testing, then we will have to replicate that into all the stages, and that will be impossible. I mean, because if we start, like, saying, okay, let's personalize this unit testing, then, I mean, we have to find a way of doing all together, because otherwise it's going to be impossible, the training, the UIT, like everything.

 I don't know. I mean, this was a problem from the beginning. We all agree. But they have to figure it out the way to, I mean, they didn't want to provide, how do you say, like a product or, yeah, a representative of all, so then they will have to adapt to the consequences, or this will be the time that... So, yeah, in the...

Pelayo Fernandez:
Can you put the sessions? I think I put it in the... I share it somewhere.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, well, I can share them here, or you want the calendar?

Pelayo Fernandez:
We have three sessions. For demand planning, we have three sessions for inventory planning. So, those are two days. No, no, sorry, three days. Then we have. Yeah, I mean, here we have demand planning, demand planning, demand planning.

Rocio Minguillon:
So, three sessions for demand planning, then three for inventory. Yeah, and then the same thing, and Friday we have anything, and then the same thing for chemicals, and Exactly.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Yeah, so the idea will be to have all the users, I don't know how many they are, but whatever, let's say 10, 15, during these sessions. Yeah. These are the users.

Rocio Minguillon:
I'm not sure, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure about who is involved in what. I mean, my maintenance is involved in...

Pelayo Fernandez:
But we have in total 11 agencies. You have here just a few agencies, I have, no, I have 11.

Rocio Minguillon:
I have quarters and all these ones. Oh, then it's fine.

Pelayo Fernandez:
How many users do we have? For example, that, that, uh, Al-Hafra.

Rocio Minguillon:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Uh.

Rocio Minguillon:
OK, I got like an Yeah, here is repeated, but between the ages I think it's not repeated or yes 123456789.

Pelayo Fernandez:
1011 12. 1314 15. 16, 17, not just 16, 16 users. Yes. I mean, it is what it is, but yeah, I agree. Let's propose that 16 users in three sessions.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Pelayo Fernandez:
And regarding the travel, I believe, and I don't know if you believe the same thing, that is a good idea. Us being there, even though it is very likely that they're just going to connect. So the first point is that we're going to be in place with KPMG in the same time zone. If we don't go there, we can start working at super early. And then if we need to work on something, we need to fix something, I don't know when we can do it.

 So I think it's better to work, like, do some intense work during these 10 days with Hector. Of course, we're going to be requesting your support here, Tim. But for me, it's better. At this point, it's better. And we already booked the hotels. We already bought the tickets. So there's nothing much we can do at this point. I'm open to explore different options here in Madrid if we find the right reasons for that, but I don't know.



Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, I don't think that Mohammed will accept the time zone reason. I mean, he will say that we can fix it, but I mean, it was Because what we were talking yesterday, I mean, if we do the unit testing remotely, I mean, we can't cancel the unit testing, because if you

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
cancel...

Rocio Minguillon:
No, we cannot. We can't. So... Yeah. They have to try to keep them in the same room at least, so some of them can have access to the system. Yeah, I don't know if Rahul tried to install the complement in his computer.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Hector, you have to travel. So you tell me, do you want to travel?

Hector Palacios:
Do you think something else is better to stay? Not sure, to be honest. What?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Not sure. Whatever we decide.

Hector Palacios:
I'm sure. On that two minutes. I don't know why they want to constrain us.

Pelayo Fernandez:
They spend the whole time there. Okay, I'm gonna ask your wife. No?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, I mean having the sessions 7 a.m. All the days, it's kind of cheapy as well.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rocio Minguillon:
Okay, so let's try to push them to find a way of having a room and also the computers of KPMG available to the users to access to the tool. And today, if they told us to change and not going, then I have to ask about the cost of that. Because I'm not sure if the flight that Cesar bought is flexible. And yeah, I'm not sure about all that stuff. So maybe it's the same.

Pelayo Fernandez:
the decision today. Yes. Because otherwise we won't be able to change the ticket.

Rocio Minguillon:
Did you ask Cesar of the flexibility of the ticket? And you, Hector, who bought your ticket? It's not going to be on it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Pelayo Fernandez:
No, this is a general rule. Message any time you you ask for for buy tickets to go there you buy flexibles because we know these things happen all the time that we have to reboot the flight and whatever so we better prevent this from happening

Rocio Minguillon:
uh yeah I don't know I I didn't I didn't I mean cesar bought the tickets you didn't tell me but but I will ask you. Okay. What else? Then, well, for today, we have the date for delivering the presentation of the data requirements. Yeah, it's almost done.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I have to publish some details and I will send it to Vishal later.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
Anything else? I mean, yesterday we reviewed all the tasks of the technical team. I don't know if there is a risk or something that you want to raise, or if everything is going well in the terms of the integration, the documentation, the accesses, well, everything.

Rocio Minguillon:
Everything is clear from my end. I mean... Yeah, of course, it's fine. Okay, Sagar and Ray, do you want to raise something, or...?

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
It's everything okay? Yeah, they're still pending the authorization to Borús. I sent an email, I think I copied you, Rocio?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. So...

Rocio Minguillon:
Yes, yesterday Kunal or Rahul told me that today they were going to do something. So, yeah, I have that on mind, but I think that until today it's not. Kunal was with that, or Rahul, one of them, I don't remember.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
But yes. OK, perfect.

Rocio Minguillon:
But is that like blocking us like right now or not yet? Because I understand that we have to deliver the FSD to start like developing, but...

Reinaldo Gutierrez:
I think in Baruch we can do the development because I think that's a sandbox. Sandbox. So if we have the authorization, we can start with the extract or enhancement and all that.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Okay.

Rocio Minguillon:
That's why I am asking for those roles. Okay. Yes, perfect. Okay, and something that I, sorry, anything else from the technical side?

Pelayo Fernandez:
So, Rocio, what about you? Remember, you're going to send an email?

Rocio Minguillon:
I mean, I spoke with Isabel and Alejandra, and today I will ask them again about it, but which email are you talking about? But not that email, you said you're going to speak with them or send an email, I'm not sure. I already speak with them and they told me that yes, that they will be reviewing it, so today I will ask them how did that go. Okay. But yes. Okay, then something that I wanted to raise, Basti, was that they are trying They are asking me to help on being really clear about the prerequisites of the things.

 Because they saw that for the unit testing, as a whole team, like with KPMG, we were not ready because they didn't schedule the sessions with the correct anticipation. They didn't organize the thing about the laptops and the space and the availability of the users and a lot of that stuff. So now they are asking me to review the activities that we have for the next month and the prerequisites that we think we have.

 And I can do that. And I do that internally. I mean, it's my job. But I'm really worried about they like lying on our responsibility on that because it's their responsibility. I mean, I can help and I should know all of this because it's my internal work. But the PMO role in the whole project is them. So I don't have to be worrying and you don't have to be worrying about all these structure and all these tasks.

 I mean, the dynamics should be they told us to do and we do it. But I'm worried that this starts to scale, because, yeah, I mean, I can do it, but I don't want to, they, like, give us that responsibility that is them, there. So, for example, if I miss something about the UIT, okay, then what? It's going to be our responsibility? No. I mean, it's them. So, just for you to keep it in mind, that they are, like, blaming us.

 For some things that are not our responsibility. So, yes.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I mean, of course, we have to give at least the general requirements and then prerequisites, as you're saying. But then they have to define the final details. But I wouldn't be that worried. I think don't start blaming each other who's responsible for what.

Rocio Minguillon:
Yeah, of course.

Pelayo Fernandez:
No, no, I understand what you're saying. I do. It's just that, it's just, if we don't, if we don't say what are the prerequisites, they're not kind of figured out by themselves. Okay. We know how these guys are, so let's try to... Yeah, I will do my best, but I will do my best.

Rocio Minguillon:
And I will do my best, and that is my, and of course I will do my best, I'm dedicating time to Tara and I'm helping her with everything. But just for you to know that at some point, then we have to be clear on if we are missing something, they should recognize that.

Pelayo Fernandez:
I mean, for me, we need to define this prerequisite, but it's clear that responsible for it, scheduling the meetings for defining the names of the key users, or I don't know, arranging the booking, the rooms, these are their responsibility. And I think that's clear.

Rocio Minguillon:
And we could, I mean, if we can manage to make things more clear for them, Yeah, yes, yes, of course, but yeah, on the part of recognizing, I think that they should also be very careful and review the things because they can, they are more, they are like seeing the high level in a more, in a better way because they don't have to be in the day-to-day of these activities.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Yeah, valid point, then let's mention, let's say. Please, Kai, if we see meetings are coming and you need more info sooner than what we are providing, then please push us to give those details. Otherwise, we will end up in this awkward situation.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, perfect.

Rocio Minguillon:
Thank you. Well, any other point, Tim?

Rocio Minguillon:
Oh, okay. Thank you. So let me know if there is something.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.

Pelayo Fernandez:
Bye bye. Thank you, bye.
