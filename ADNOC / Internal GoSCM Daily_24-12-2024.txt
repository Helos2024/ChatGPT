For example, as I was saying, running a statistical forecast. Okay, that is a core functionality that the user needs to know how to do, and they have to review the results.\n\n That's fine. Let me give you the opposite example. I don't know, dashboards. We don't even have yet the confirmation of analytic stories. So, first of all, we cannot test it, but even if we have access to it, I don't think at this point it's a core functionality to test. So, I wouldn't put it on the MVP. Of course, in the UITs, we will test everything. We should try to test everything, but it's not the MVP.\n\n This is the introduction for to IDP to users hands on."},{"start_time":1735046092923,"end_time":1735046111898,"speaker":{"name":"Vivekanand Gajula"},"words":"Yeah, so I get your point, you know.

But so first of all, the idea is to be on site to do this testing, okay? So they can ask as many questions as they like regarding this topic. And they can get hands-on and they can have ownership on the tool, like understanding what's going on, ask questions, put some more requirements in the backlog if they feel it's the right thing to do, so on and so forth.\n\n We are here addressing several points. The first of all is that this is going to be the first time that the users are actually using IDP. We have to guide them and teach them how to use it so they can see what is the actual benefit of the tool. For me, this is actually when the projects all this preparation that has taken two or three months is nothing but just an excuse to start doing what we're going to do now, which is to show the configuration and fix it, adjust it based on users' feedback.\n\n And we need to build with them the only way we can build with them in a collaborative way is to be with them in full and use IPP with them to address their requirements. But for that, we need to start with a very simple example. We cannot start by doing everything. Otherwise, it's going to be very complicated. The sessions would be very exhausting and we won't be able to add too much value. So that's why it's the concept of of the MVP.\n\n Let's try it with the core functionalities. Let's make sure they are working as expected."},{"start_time":1735046263600,"end_time":1735046334075,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"And from there, we can build more. Yes, and maybe Vivek, just to help with that level of detail, I think that Fiamma is using, like, for the base, is using these test conditions to manage that we described during the VPDs. Yeah, using the same. Ah, nice. Okay. And I think that that level of detail is OK. Also, I need to confirm while we are confirming the plan. But I think that the training that we are going to develop the content, the training and this unit testing with users will be at the same time.\n\n So maybe they will be reviewing the content of the training material with KPMG at the same time that we are doing this, so maybe that that will be helpful. But yeah, now that this level of detail is okay, because then we are gonna be with them, like, showing how to do each of the steps. Does it sound good to you? I have a question."},{"start_time":1735046334075,"end_time":1735046356959,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Sorry, Rocio and Bastian.

It's on short of short, if I'm not wrong. Is there a gas maybe, Arun? Sound gas, yeah.

But for MRO, where we have, I don't know how many agencies, let's say 10, we cannot have, I don't know, 20 users.\n\n So we should define who's going to be the key users. And they are the one that, first of all, of course, need to have the Excel ID in their laptop and also have the users. And it's something we need to work with KPMG, and I think we should put that as a task, define a key user for user testing in MVP."},{"start_time":1735046879101,"end_time":1735046931283,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Yes, yes, sure, sure, sure. This Thursday we already have a call to start with that point or to see what do they have regarding that. But yes, I will put the task, and I was planning to ask for all those requirements, like next week, like the first week of January, to say, OK, we are planning to do the unit testing these dates. I mean, we have to define the dates this week also. And so say, OK, we need this, this, and this.\n\n That means the Excel add-in and also the users in IPP. Definitely but yeah on Thursday we will have that meeting for the year."},{"start_time":1735046931283,"end_time":1735047154375,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah and also before the end of this year we need to define the travel plan okay I understand that some of you have some personal situations in which you cannot travel so we need to also address that but I can say right away it would be good if during the end of January because the idea is to do this testing at the end of January. Pretty much, I don't know, at least the leads, which is Saul, Arun and Vivek, can be there for one or two weeks.\n\n I understand that some of you guys are going through personal situations and we can discuss that, but not here, okay? But the idea is we're gonna come up with a proposal and then we're gonna discuss Because if it's possible, of course, it will be feasible. From Vivek, again, I understand that, of course, you are the lead from supply. So the MVP should be the user testing slash MVP will be in probably in February.\n\n But if you can be also in January supporting Saul, that will be great. OK. We'll see. We'll see. Understand that we need to come up with a plan and then discuss it. So for now, it's just so you know, but it's not 100% confirmed. And of course, Hector and I also will be there. We need to check the budget, but I think from this point onward, It is the more, for me, the most critical part of the project because we will start dealing directly with the users using the tool.\n\n Not just showing presentations and demos and stuff for me now. For me, actually, the project, the real project, the actual project starts now. All the rest has been a preparation for this phase of the project. And I understand in a certain degree the frustration from users because they are pushing for this moment to get hands on the system. And I think we share that feeling because the way we used to work is to get on board with the users using IVP as soon as possible.\n\n But because of all this bureaucracy and this old-fashioned project like with so many documents this has been super delayed this has created some delays and frustration with with the user which of course we want to revert by doing this MVP so yeah I hope we are all on the same page and we are all on board and we can be very patient dealing with the users, with the questions, so on and so forth. But again, for me, as a summary of what I've been saying, the project starts now, and the idea is to get all the users, all the key users on board using ADP, using the system, and not just saying, I need this, I need that, and talking just on very abstract, with a very abstract, with a very limited understanding of the tool, OK, team, thank you very much.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735047154375,"end_time":1735047170369,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"I don't know if there is any other point.
