Sagar Vora:
Hello, everyone. Shall we drop off? We can update Rocio once he starts the call. Yes, I think so, Sagar, because if Rocio is not here, we cannot do anything, I think. Yes, correct. So I'm going to drop a message to Rochelle once she's back, so we can join back. Sure, sir. Thank you. Bye, guys. Thank you. You
