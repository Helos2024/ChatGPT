Sorry, the next one is the one that I was thinking of Segmentation to determine the AV plan type.\n\n So this one, we could take it, the other one, no. I don't know what they were saying, but if this is an RP type, they should know better than us. Working example on AVP, you're the point planning and advanced supply planning. Maybe this one is what you can help us, Vivek, like to put some demo capture space.

It's more related to us for hiring it. For us, it's not really important. And I really, I said on the administration that they need to, if they want us to include that, the KPMG team is going to check that.\n\n So you only focus on reorder point planning, advanced supply planning, do some Excel mockups. One is with forecast, the other one is without forecast, basically. That's it. And then work in Excel. For determining the IEPP planning type.
