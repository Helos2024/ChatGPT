Pablo Lopez:
See you tomorrow, right? Yes, yes. I'll be there at 6.50pm. What time will you be there?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
At 11.50pm.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's late.

Hector Palacios:
Late, late.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
But I have a lot of time. What time? At 11.50pm I'll be there. Tonight.

Fiamma Giorgi:
Hello team. Hola. Hello, everyone.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye. You Hello, Kim. Hello.

Hector Palacios:
But yeah, I thought she was going to join to this one.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
She's not going to join.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, because I don't think that we have any other topic important to discuss right now. I think that we need to work on our own right now.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
the replied, maybe we can add Suleiman as well. Should we drop off?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sagar, are you there?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
What was the last update from SAP? They asked me to perform some steps, basically some solutions.

Sagar Vora:
If that works, then fine. If it doesn't work, then they ask for the logs. So today morning, in my morning, I submitted all the logs from the agent. So now we are waiting for SAP to revert back with possible solution.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
And question, what is the priority, high or very It's time.

Sagar Vora:
I think the delay is also from the Adnox side because they asked for the logs two days back. Okay. So I was behind them, but somehow yesterday in my afternoon, we finished the activity to generate the logs, but I received this logs today morning, basically yesterday late night. Around 12 a.m. So I checked my email today morning. So I saw the log then and finally I uploaded that log to SAP and asked them to analyze the log.



Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Is there a way to prevent this from happening again right now? Like is there a way that I don't know who has the user but that I don't know automatically forward the email to you?

Sagar Vora:
No, no means I am already checking on my city. So because I have raised the ticket with the Hector's ID. So I'm following up there.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
And what is the S S No, no, I'm not sure on that.

Hector Palacios:
So, sir, did you raise this ticket with my user?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes.

Hector Palacios:
Can you raise the priority? Because we have only one yes user, I think. Yeah, let's do the following. Let's open a chat expert, and please raise the priority to very high. So they can react.

Sagar Vora:
I will do that. No, I think they are replying, but I think the Adnox from the Adnox side they are also very slow but I will change the priorities to very high I will request the experts because how many day has has been since this issue started almost means I think I raised that ticket last Friday so from last Friday almost a week almost a week yeah Yeah. So I think daily I'm sending emails so that the whole team is aware, like, but yeah, like it was an AdNoc ID because Kaiser basically the whole AdNoc team to whom I'm escalating the Khalid and all were on the AdNoc, so I was using that ID, but I will look for the GoSCM ID also, like yours and Rocio.



Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
I don't know if anyone has something else to mention, but let's recap a little bit of what is going to be the end of this week. Today, we have an integration session. It is booked for an hour, but maybe we won't use the entire hour, but the idea is to check the documentation that we're going to share with KPMG, check the documentation that we're going to keep to ourselves, and let's try to allow I understand you had a call this morning, did you?

 Because someone was speaking BVIC as well.

Hector Palacios:
Why BVIC is not here?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I don't know, probably.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
So they were discussing about the different extractors. Were you in that meeting, Sagar? No, I was not there. The idea is to, like I said, we're going to review, well, we can talk about this during the integration meeting. And we will have that meeting with them tomorrow.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
But first, I want to be very clear on what is going to be the input that we're going to give to them. And most importantly, what are we going to ask for them, right?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Because there's no way we share the information about what we're doing if they're not going to help us.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
If it's just another layer of reporting then there's no need for that. Yeah, great. What else?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Of course tomorrow we have, that is what people here in Spain will meet at the office. Are you going to the office Fiamma tomorrow?

Fiamma Giorgi:
Not here of course. We don't have office in Cordoba but we meet in someone's houses.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, that sounds good. What else?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
That's it.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Well, just so you know, there is a big change in the demand planning but we're gonna keep you updated once we have the full information. But it is very likely that we're gonna do the next week demand planning session at least as as initially thought, but chemicals stay as it is. So, yeah.

Hector Palacios:
So, basically, it seems that we are not going to use the demand planning for MRO. That seems to be the case, because they work on a structure in which they work with reservations and approved reservations, and they cannot trigger the based on a forecast, there needs to be something approved. So, very likely that for MRO, we are not going to do the planning for PRs, maybe strategically, but yeah, but that is not going to be a big point in the implementation.



Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
No, the big point, yeah, we are speaking here about MRO and chemicals drilling, it's a completely different story, but the core is going to be the reorder calculation and good news for yeah for mro yeah for mro and for chemicals it's different because yeah in some cases you do have forecasts and you do yeah good thing pelayo and pablo tomorrow we're gonna have a um a master class from hector for reorder point calculation we will we have been struggling with this calculation but we finally got it so gonna be interesting and you will be in the cutting edge of inventory planning for spare parts we're gonna charge you just 2,000 euros each no more than that okay okay

Hector Palacios:
if it's worth it then okay yeah only your whole salary man yeah all right Any additional points to discuss?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Anyone?

Arun Singh:
So basically for MRO there will be direct demand upload? Only work orders, basically. Only work orders.

Hector Palacios:
Only work orders, okay. Yeah, work orders and reorder points. So we will base this on consumption. To be reactive. And for the future work orders, yes, they will be tried to be anticipated, but it's based on a sectional input.

Arun Singh:
Okay. So, based on the work orders and on top of some adjustment, there will be a final demand, right?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So, yes, exactly.

Arun Singh:
So, for this is only good news. It's one entire process less for us.

Hector Palacios:
So that's great. And also I wasn't, I never liked that process because I think that is not the strong part of IVP, creating a forecast for very, very rare events like the ones that we are having on MRO, like every one year or twice a year, that is very low consumption, very low frequency. So I think that that's, That is a very good news for us, I think. Not only on effort, but also on how IBT will look like for the end-users.



Arun Singh:
Okay, so basically only chemicals will be having demand-loading gate.

Saul Portillo:
Yeah, that's right. And Hector, this definition is taken by Agnoc?

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, they were with one guy called Derek. I don't know who he is or what his charge is, but he was saying this and also he mentioned something like 1,000 users. I don't know, something like that. At least we and KPMG so far are aligned for MRO, reorder point-based planning, and that's it. We also were thinking on MRO like for the only fast movers if we use file more we were not like 100% sure for that for all the fast movers but so far we know the fast movers are a very low percentage of the the whole the whole scope so it doesn't change a lot from us there because we we were going to do reorder point-based planning for the 95% of the cases either way but yeah This is going to save us a lot of the trainings, you know, because regardless of the amount of items that you are going to forecast, you need to involve people and so on.

 So I think that is good because these users that are from maintenance, they are not very system wise. They are more working in the ground, you know, repairing stuff, not playing with Excel or anything like that. So I think that is It wasn't a good idea to involve them. So, would you know that is an under constraint now from our side.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
Okay, but I want to be very clear on the change.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
So, of course, as Hector is saying, initially, MRO is still like 95, 98% of the materials were reorder the paint base. So the forecast, even though we created it, it's not going to be used for trigger the PR creation. But the problem was that we still had like a demand planning phase step that involves people from the maintenance team, engineers, basically. Okay, so we are basically killing that part, but the demand planning phase, more strategic, we're planning to, of course, look, if we're able to integrate the budget from somewhere, that's good, and look at the budget on a very high level, on a yearly basis, or even on the lowest level, could be quarterly, and then look it for the next five years.

 Just, I don't know, to drive, strategic decisions like, I don't know, start buying from a new supplier or start cutting contracts, whatever.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
But these are more tactical and strategic decisions that are going to be made by inventory planners, inventory controllers, not by the people from the maintenance team.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
So we need to have super clear the distinction between and who is consuming the items and who's buying it. So inventory controllers will be centralized in this new share services. And these guys are in charge of supplying spare parts.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
That's their job.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Buying items and supply the right parts at the right time. And on the other hand, you the engineers in the preventive side, which their work is to keep the operation running. OK, so they are not thinking about how much they need to consume, how much they will consume next. Their job is to keep the machines running. And for that, they, of course, use their reservation. But when they need the material, not thinking in two years, three years.

 So that's the job of inventory controllers, supply the materials because there's no way to create a reliable forecast because the consumption is very intermittent. Then the only way to address this problem is through a right safety stock, right? To have the material already in place for if the consumption happens, you're ready for that. And this is the value that we are in. We're calculating a very sophisticated Yeah, safety stock reorder point.

 Okay. And also, on the top of that, we're giving a long term visibility for the inventory controllers to be ready to start, I don't know, dealing, negotiating contracts, so on and so forth.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
And then we have the supply part, which is another story.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
But that's a full picture.

Saul Portillo:
Okay, a question. I'm still working in statistical forecast for MRO because we are with Fiamma working the process for approvals, okay, in the process management and try to do it the old process when... For chemicals. It's still valid for chemicals.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
For chemicals, nothing has changed. Not for MRO. You can kill it. No, we're still going to forecast but the forecast will not be transferred to independent demand or consensus demand, no.

Saul Portillo:
Okay, we need to jump for reorder point, build the reorder point part for MRO and later duplicate the process but for the chemical, the forecast chemical.

Hector Palacios:
Now, that is a higher priority, Saul, to have it for our Sorry, for MRO, the reorder point. Approval. That is the first priority because it's the first session that we will have. I think it's next week.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, the week after that. And I'm still working on a more strategic plan workspace where we have the forecast for the next five years and historical consumption for the last five years. But again, We don't know how this is going to be, but still we need to. Yeah. I think we'll, it's still as Hector said, it makes things easier.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Okay.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
Cool guys. See you tomorrow. Well, can you say five minutes?

Hector Palacios:
Me?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Yeah.

Sagar Vora:
No, there's no way.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No way?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
You need to. You need to.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No way.

Hector Palacios:
Okay guys, see you. Thank you guys. Bye bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
See you. Bye.

Hector Palacios:
I don't know, this operator thing doesn't work for me. It only gives me 0.5. The CV? For Casero. Did it give you anything when you played it?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Hector Palacios:
Can you send me a screenshot of how you configured it? I'm The presentation was cancelled, the project was cancelled, and all that. Where was this open? It would be great if we could export the planning workspaces. We would make projects out of nothing.

Hector Palacios:
The truth is that I don't understand what he's doing because he doesn't even respect me. He throws me a 0.5 and not even a 0.5. In fact, I changed it to 0.3 in case there was... If it couldn't be calculated, I put... Well, there it was returned.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
But look at the forecast, I mean, what... And is that forecast full for the past?

Hector Palacios:
No, it doesn't have anything. But I imagine that in that case it would say...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's why it has 0.5, or... Ah, of course.

Hector Palacios:
Minimum number of periods, or 6 in forecast. I mean, it has to have forecast too, I mean...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I'm trying, ok.

Hector Palacios:
I'm going to throw the X-Bow to see what it gives me. But it's going to give me any UA, that's the thing. We better take it out. And if we take this UA out like this. A 0 only. Fuck the UA. But then this UA is not going to serve us, dammit. Otherwise we're going to have forks.

Hector Palacios:
Let's see if we can do some good damage, but... But it was an X-Bow, man. Yeah, no, it was an X-Bow, but... But, fuck, it doesn't make much sense to put it in now, man.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I'm sorry.

Hector Palacios:
I'm going to run it in the meantime. I'll tell you how it goes. In the end, I imagine that even if you bring any number, how much it's going to get worse.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
But look, can you keep projecting?

Hector Palacios:
Wait, I'm going to fix the...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Go down. Ok, I'm going to go down.

Hector Palacios:
I'm going to go back to 5. Do you want to see more?

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
Go down a bit.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Anyway, look at this.

Hector Palacios:
Historical Demand Copies in Operation. So... I'm going to throw the fork just so I can block but it calculates me only related to the demand there are a lot of things here, look if you go down a little more there are a lot of measures, I'm not interested in these, these are forks that last here no, but the one that is below, look calculation settings setting related to CV, mean absolute deviation but there are more things I'm going to change it It's changing the

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
other model that has nothing to do with it, Juan.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Look, mean absolute deviation.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 1:
No, but unfold it. I don't know, Juan. Can you say that using this...

Hector Palacios:
No, I don't know.

Conference Room (Bastian Osorio) - Speaker 2:
Standard deviation of forecast error. Mean absolute...

Hector Palacios:
Before, the math, they had an approximation. I would have to dig, but I'm sure that the coefficient of variability that they calculated in a weirder way, the Forca zero, was simpler. It was like the math divided by the maximum between the Forca and the Actuar, if I remember correctly. It was like a simplification of a I'm not sure, I don't agree yet. And now I'm going to...

Hector Palacios:
Finally, I throw myself the second trap.

Hector Palacios:
He hasn't done any merch, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What?

Hector Palacios:
I'm sure this ball has changed, I don't understand why now... Foreign Foreign you you Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Oh, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
For the past. Excellent. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

Hector Palacios:
Bye!
