So yesterday, there was an Ad-hoc call with Vignesh and Santam from Adnok. We all connected, and there was some discussion. They were saying no firewall request will be required. It should connect via proxy server, that's CIDS and agent. There was some discussion and finally they took that call and we updated the STD on the spot and we got the approval for proxy request. Today, we started with the configuration.\n\n Is not approved, but we started with the configuration. Today, we were in Kaiser was doing all, means I was supporting and there was a team from SAP who was performing on the task. So later we came to know like firewall will be required, firewall request will be required again. So again, we are back to zero. So we completed our steps, but the agent and CIDS is still not connected. It's still red, but now we have request created a new firewall request again.\n\n And once it is approved, then some firewall-related steps will be performed at ad-hoc end. And then we can check the server. So the agent is up and running, or we are still facing any issues. And for STD, the center means we He was not okay with some of the pointers, but that was a standard one. So I think as discussed on 24th call, we had sent one email to SAP team for their comments.

So that's why today call was scheduled. So mostly we did our activity, but connection is not established yet. So I think some firewall issues are coming. So I think we have raised a new ticket now.\n\n And once it is approved, then AdNoc team will open the gates basically for that firewall.
