Hello, how are you?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
How are you, team?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Eva, haven't you taken a day off?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 3:
I took a day off yesterday afternoon, because I had to be connected in the morning.

Bastian Osorio:
And now I had to get a couple of things. At the end of the year I had a couple of things left that I couldn't disconnect. How are you, VÃ¡zquez and Hector?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
We are going to ask a few questions.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hi, Sagar. Hi, Aruba.

I'm fine, too. Well, before starting, I wanted to say that I wish you a happy new year this night and tomorrow. Yeah, and well, yeah, I hope that you enjoy with your family, with your friends, or with everyone is with you. And congratulations for this year. I know that it has been a tough end of the year, as we were with a lot of activities regarding the project. But I think that we made it very good.

 So congratulations. And well, let's recharge our batteries for the next year. I don't know if anyone else. Want to say something, but we are going to do a retrospective today in this session. First, I want to review just a few minutes if there is any urgent activity or any point that you want to share. But after, we are going to do a kind of retrospective with a dynamic that I will present. So we will have also time to highlight the things that we have been doing good and everything.

 I don't know if anyone wants to say something. Bastian, I think that you were going to speak. Okay. Can you hear me?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Can you hear me?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Yes. Give me a second.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sure.

Bastian Osorio:
No, I just want to want to give thank you to everybody because everybody has been putting a lot of effort Thank you guys for that. We need to keep with the same energy and hopefully now I'm pretty sure we will be able to make this a successful project. So let's try to make this meeting quick so the guys from India, Arun, Vivek, Sagar can disconnect and share with their families, celebrate.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Sure, sure. What time is there?

Bastian Osorio:
Like five hours more, I think here. Yeah, 7 p.m.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Okay, so maybe we can do a retrospective on next Monday, what do you think? I mean, because I was going to take the whole half an hour, but if it's okay with you, Matthew, we can do it. I don't know.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Maybe on Friday. Friday?

Bastian Osorio:
Can we do it on Friday?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
I'm not working on Friday, that's why.

Sagar Vora:
That's why I was saying.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
On Thursday?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Neither.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Neither?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Okay. No, it's fine. I don't know, Arun, Vivek, how are you on time now? We can do it now, I think. Okay, so let's do this.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
I don't know if there's any point that anyone wants to raise. I already aligned with Sagar and with Reinaldo. I had a little call before this with I know the status and the next activities on the integration side. But I don't know if there is anything else that you want to ask, Hector or Vasti. I think that we're all aligned so we can start the retrospective. Okay. Yes.

Bastian Osorio:
I had a meeting this morning with Sagar. Catch up with everything regarding integration.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Okay. Perfect. Well, Tim, I will share now with you a link that I prepared here in this whiteboard. You will see this, which is the objective of this retrospective. Well, the objective is to analyze how we work as a team and with the customer, The customers, I mean KPMG and also AdNoc, identify strengths and also the opportunities for improvement and generate some actions for the continuity of the project.

 Today, we're going to focus on the first two points. I mean, we're going to identify these things that I'm going to tell you. And then after this meeting next week, we are going to work on the actions and putting some deadlines to that actions and that. But for now, we are just going to think about how are we doing and what do we want to change. So you will receive this link. And this is anonymously.

 I don't know if that word is correct. Anonymous? Anonymous? Yeah, I think. Do you understand? Yeah. It's anonymous. And here you will find this. We are this boat. This is our goal, that is this island, that is to have a good project and to achieve all the objectives of each of the stages that we have. So these are the things that we should keep doing, the things that we are doing already and the things that you think we are doing right.

 These are the things that we should start doing, like some new ideas, some new opportunities that you see about other projects, or simply ideas that you have that we can start doing to improve. And these are the things that we should stop doing, or the things that we are not doing as well as we can, and that are like keeping us like this boat here, this thing. So, think about everything regarding the project.

 I mean, think about our communication internally, the communication with the client, the collaboration. Think about specifically this stage that we already finished, that is the stage of the Explorer. Think about each of the sessions and think about scheduling, the client visibility, the internal visibility. Think about the session dynamics. Everything that we put on here is for improving. So don't be afraid of saying, okay, these dailies are not very productive and should be twice a week and with this dynamic.

 Don't worry about saying that kind of things because that is the idea. Also, think about the risk detection, how we deal with the different issues. Well, think about everything related to the stage and the dynamic of the stage that we already finished. And, well, that we will take like 10 minutes just to you to complete this. You will, well, here you have to zoom out. Zoom in and zoom out with your mouse or with your mouse pad.

 And then here you can add the different texts, like just writing. You can write in, well, preferably in English, but then if there are some ideas that you can explain it faster in Spanish or in another language, and then becomes translated, there is no problem also. And well, I think that that is all. I will share with you the link, and I will put some music so we can spend these 10 minutes thinking about this.

 Is everything clear?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What do you think?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
And Pelayo, of course, and Pablo, as you are kind of new in the process, Of course, I'm not expecting you to put a lot of comments, but maybe there is something that you already noticed being in the sessions and being here in the project. So feel free to add whatever you want. And well, I will be also completing this activity. And well, that's all. I don't know if it's clear the idea, the objective, the goal of this?



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes or no? Yeah, clear. It's clear. Yeah. OK.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
I will share the link. Let me know. I don't know if you can. This is part of the methodology that we are following at GoSCM, like doing this retrospective after each of the stages. We also did it in some other projects, and we discovered that it's very interesting, the things that came after this, so let me know if you can enter. I see that Pelayo is entering, Saul. After you write the comment, we can't see like your name or anything.

 So it's not anonymous.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, it is.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It is.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
I mean, when you are like moving around, I can see like your the name of your of your click. But then when you write, I mean, I don't know who writes each of the of the notes. I will lock this.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Okay, now we are right. Let me know if everyone is okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So, this is only for the Explorer?

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, for the Explorer and general.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
I mean, if you already detect that, I mean, I talked about the Explorer, so you can, like, focus on the activities that we have been doing, but if you have comments regarding other work streams, it's okay. Or other stages. I mean, we started with some things of the configuration, so if you see that there are things to highlight or to improve from there, it's okay to add it.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
That it's that's sounds good for you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Okay.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Okay, so I will start with the Peace.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
And I want to put something.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Well, team, now what we are going to do is we're going to take a few minutes, like four minutes, to review all the notes. And you will select, like, two of each of the quadrants, of each of the, I don't know if that word is it, of each of the, of each of the, which is the word? Categories.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sections. Sections.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
You will choose two to prioritize, yeah? So for choosing, you will use the, you will use, you can use, if you want to be anonymous, you can put these stickers here. So you can put it there, for example, and there. So that is my two votes. And then after these sessions, we will review each of the activities, but we will prioritize the ideas that have more votes. So let's take a few more minutes to read, and please just both two from each of the categories.

 Understood? Yes? No.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Can you repeat about the categories? Yes, sure.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
You have to take... We need to define a mass of data for each one of them? No. You should choose two...

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Transactional data.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
You should choose two of the nodes to prior... The ones that you think that are most important, you should put a sticker, just two of each category. For example, I would put stickers or reactions, whatever.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, sticker, reaction or attributes.

Conference Room (Rocio Minguillon) - Speaker 1:
Yes, whatever.
