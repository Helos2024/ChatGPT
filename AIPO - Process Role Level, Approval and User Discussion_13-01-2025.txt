UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good afternoon, everyone. So, when we have the document is created for this.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
and Muhammad Bakhshiri and the rest of the team are still on another call. So we're just going to wait a few minutes for them to wrap that call up and then we'll get started on this call. So we might begin 10 minutes, thanks. You Hi everyone. For those people who have just joined, we're just waiting for Rahul and the rest of the team to join. They're just wrapping up another call. So as soon as everyone has joined, then we will start.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you for the break. Sure.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
you you Yeah, we can start. Just give me a minute. I'm just asking Rahul to join here. Because we had another meeting before it for chemicals. So we're just winding up. Yeah, so I'm in the same room as Rahul.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
They look like they're ending the call now, if I've been about a minute. The document is complete and we can take it for a vote.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Khushboo, is Rahul joining here? Yes, Khalid.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
He will be joining in just another minute. I'm sorry for the wait.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay. Who will be initiating the meeting? Let's start now, because we've been waiting.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think, Khalid, we can start and Rahul will continue. Okay, I'll get started. Thank you very much for your time. I'm just going to share my screen. So for the people who weren't here in last week's meeting, what we're basically doing is we have all of the different roles that are mapped to the different process variants across demand planning, inventory planning and supply planning. And we also have the descriptions of the roles.

 And then we have been mapping out the level at which each of whether it's at an AGC level, at a plant level, or a department level. And we've also been establishing the level at which the approval occurs. And then we've also been trying to identify the headcount for each of the different roles, because that'll be used to identify the key users associated with each of those roles. So in last week's meeting, we went through all the roles for planning.

 We also went through all the roles for inventory planning and the purpose of today's call is to finish this off to go through the roles for supply planning and then to go through some of the additional roles which we would like to discuss in terms of process champions and the like, So I'll be starting here on supply planning under MRO. So for supply planning we have an inventory controller, inventory planner, inventory team lead and inventory manager.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So we would start by going.

Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, team, I think Kyle got disconnected. One second.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Can everyone see the screen? Yeah. Okay.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, I'm not sure where I got cut off, but today we're going to be going through the supply planning roles, starting with the inventory controller. So the inventory controller is responsible for the creation of PRs and STRs. We would first like to establish at which level this role sits.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
A question here, team.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
In the last meeting, we discussed roles and response set of inventory controller in terms of inventory controller and inventory planner. Will the same org be doing this activity, which means that can we refer to the input provided on inventory control inventory planner from inventory control conversation and apply to the supply planning. Is this something fair assumption or correct assumption?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Rahul, as per our previous discussion, both the titles belongs to the same same role, like there is no difference between controller and planner here in the shared services.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Noted, noted.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So so the question here is that can Can we apply the discussion from inventory planning discussion we had in last week and apply to the supply planning as well?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Is the assumption correct that the same people will be doing the inventory control planning and supply planning? Yes, I believe same assumption, number of inventory engineers, we will call it inventory engineers. And the team leaders and the managers, same hierarchy will be applied here.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And this saves us some time, considering that the same set of people are doing both inventory planning and supply planning activity.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The discussion we've had for inventory planning can be applied to the supply planning as well. OK, perfect.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Rahul, do you want to talk about the inventory team lead role? It's the same, right?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, it's the same organization doing both the activity. So, the way inventory team lead role is applying for inventory planning, the same person, inventory team lead, will be doing a supply planning review before the inventory manager approves. So, the activities changes, but the person is the same. So, in a way, these are additional responsibilities for the same person, he'll have some activities in inventory planning, he'll have some activities in supply planning.

 And as per the input, the inventory planner and inventory controller will have to, it's the same person, but it's doing different activities based upon the strategic and the nature of the we'll just align this internally between the controller and planner. So it's not a separate role. So yeah, I think it would be the same for chemicals as as for because we in the inventory we will discuss the roles and responsibilities of the how the inventory planning team is distributing chemicals drilling and MR right so whatever logic we have discussed for inventory planning same logic for supply planning can be applied with same set of people same breakup same number of people.

 So the way I see this is for the same person he has two different activities inventory planning and supply planning both the activities of the same person.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then we can move on to the additional roles that need to be discussed. So these include the process champions. Rahul, do you want to comment on any of those, please?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, so whatever roles we have discussed up till now are more of a functional role which are based upon the work which is actually happening now these are some additional rules which are required for IBP to function smoothly now process champion is someone who essentially is responsible for orchestrating end-to-end processes kind of an administrator is kind of a person who is responsible for the entire planning end-to-end and he has the stick essentially to make sure the things are happening If you have a supply planning cycle for a month, and there are 10 activities to be done across demand, inventory, and supply, then the process champion has this end-to-end visibility.

 He can question and make sure the activities in the respective areas are happening on time so that the outcome of IBP in terms of providing the right supply plan is executed month over month. So we would need, IBP would need this role to be created. Are any questions with respect to the activities of the role, we can try to answer those, but then if we are able to answer those questions, the input required from AdNoc from a business perspective is who would be the person, who would be the process champion, whether it will be able to, whether we'll need the process champions for MRO versus chemicals versus drilling in time, how this, how AdNoc looks at these roles and can suggest us how we want to define this role, whether it has AGC level, whether it's headquarters level, group company level, at what level the role would be, and how the breakup of the role between different processes should be considered for our planning.



Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Since he missed any feedback in terms of the or a process champion if we agree with this role as to where it would sit?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
It is not clear that this role belongs to AGC or HQ. This clarity should be there, then further discussion can be done.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Considering this is a process champion role and it's overarching the entire planning in IBP, demand, inventory, and supply. Who orchestrates the entire planning process so the recommendation generally is to have it at headquarters level so that from an headquarter perspective the processes can be driven at agc level month over month again and again but then yeah this is something probably adnog also needs to internalize and see that with how this role can be exercised executed in AdBlock.



Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I believe the senior most person in each inventory team can be nominated by the manager, inventory manager, something like that.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, or inventory manager can be this process champion who takes this additional responsibility because this role will have the end-to-end Sorry Rahul, just one can you clarify what actually is this process role because is it that he creates the first demand planning process?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So he is the he has the complete visibility so so whatever discussion we've had in different areas right but you will have demand you'll have inventory you'll have supply plan and there are activities like demand has to be created and approved there are activities like inventory plan has to be executed and the inventory parameters So, he will have the entire visibility of what is the current completion, where we are, is it stuck with anyone, and he has to ensure that the monthly planning cycles are executed.

 So, he has the visibility of entire plan in IPP, and he knows who's doing what, and then he can, if it is getting delayed, why it is getting delayed, he can question the person, why you're taking more time, is there any specific point. So, he is the person who is responsible responsible for ensuring the entire planning process is executed in IBP, and he has the complete visibility. So he may not do the actual task which the user is supposed to do, but then he has visibility of those tasks, who is doing, and then he has the control saying that this activity should be done by the state as agreed by the plan we are setting up in IBP.



Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So this is going to be the same SAP roles, right? Be any additional roles created within the SAP, right?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is nothing to do with SAP. This is an IBP-specific role. And the user will have the visibility of IBP. He will have visibility of the dashboard. He will have visibility of the statuses. He will have visibility of the process. So he will have complete visibility of the planning person. So he has to be someone who understands the process, who can influence the process, and who can influence the decision making so processes executed month over month over and over again in IPP by end-users when I say end-users all the people which we all the rules which were identified above the demand planner the demand manager the inventory planner and everyone in this case it is to this access to be this role to be assigned to all the inventory

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
isn't it because the individual inventory controller has its own role and for by category even inventory planner or inventory controller overcoming so the role will be same but he'll manage based on some category.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So what you are saying is that the inventory control.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Actually as Rahul is saying that this process champion will not perform the inventory controller or activities. It means we cannot nominate from the team who is actually working these activities. So then the best person is the team leader of that team who can view the end-to-end visibility and who can monitor the activities and check the performance of all the steps. So this is a proposal but final discussion can be done with the inventory managers so that they can suggest in a better way yeah yeah so how will the inventory controls have the visibility of the full process then because

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
he is doing the planning is doing the execution so if he doesn't have visibility of the entire process how are you going to you know check if there is any bottlenecks or shortfalls and he can do perform the activities

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
accordingly.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Because you know, as per the discussion, the demand planning activities also needs to be monitored by someone. So inventory control cannot monitor.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
You can give additional persons like team lead, but then the inventory control who is doing the planning aggregation, he needs to have the full visibility so that he can check wherever there's a bottleneck or any exceptions so that he

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
can amend accordingly in these plans or executions the planning under the planning team is it will be isn't it so we want to differentiate what is the planning and what is the control part of it so now we give

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
planning as the inventory controller if you see in the above planning and the controller inventory planning is both one No, we have two teams.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
So, inventory planning on team and inventory controller in another team, Rahul.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
No, actually, you know, the planning and performance role is entirely different. So, inventory planner and inventory controller role is being done by inventory teams by themselves. So, this these two to be merged in one row.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
But Tariq, as Khalifa mentioned in the very beginning of the Q&A, so the planning will not do by Inventor Controls, isn't it? So for the, especially for the MRO, the planning will be the planning team and the remaining replenishment activity will manage by. So maybe, yeah, you are right. Maybe you need a little bit more elaboration roles and all to map with the future roles.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
From our inventory control and inventory planning, we've already concluded the input what we have is the same person. The activity may be different. One is more strategic in nature. Other is more tactical in nature. But there is no separate person, which means there is no separate role is what we consider as input as for the previous conversion as well as for today's conversion.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
So, but IBP has two perspectives, isn't it? One is the demand side, one is the conclusion, the planning under the demand, and then the supply will be more on the supply planning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It's more on inventory control activity.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
So, Rahul, I believe for the process champion, you need to take the final verdict from the inventive managers. Managers and the team leaders. Yes. They can only suggest in a better way.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So let's take this action then on the team leads or inventive managers to suggest who can be the person who would be this process champion and then further do we need one process champion or will we need a process champion by MRO, by chemicals and by drilling. Okay, hi everyone.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
So what is the issue here? What is the argument that we are discussing?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hi Asma, so what we are discussing about a process champion role which is required by BP. This process champion role is essentially a person who is essentially responsible for orchestrating the entire process of demand, supply, inventory, plant in IPP. He has the visibility of entire process end-to-end and since he has visibility he understands where it is getting delayed, where he needs to push. We recommend someone senior who would be the process champion who has end-to-end visibility and he can make sure that the process is executed as planned in IPP end-to-end as per the planning cycles defined.

 If anything is getting delayed he has the authority to push things around so that he can make sure that the things come back to normal and the process is executed in time. And here you're looking for a manager level on this champion. Yes, so our recommendation is someone senior.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Now we need this input from AdNoc is who that senior person would be. See for chemicals, let's put Yasir. OK, and Willing put Khalifa. And, uh, put myself please. OK. OK, noted got it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Find this point.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, this point is fine. Thanks for the clarification.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Asma moving to the next point, we have this additional rule of a master data administrator.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Just I don't just want to clarify. Inventory controllers and the planners who are doing the execution will not have the visibility of any other process.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So roles and responsibilities when we define if they need visibility for sure we can give this that's up to AdNoc how what level of visibility.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
I think these champions will have the authority to give like someone else for example the visibility right most probably because then you will push and direct the requirement to certain people right whatever action is required so I think then every like champion will nominate someone to be maybe to take an action on certain areas this is what I understood yes that's right yes so if they would they need visibility to provide visibility or method and because if they are on leave someone has to be back back to back so it can be provided also right yeah unless if if there is a task and the person is on leave and the process stuck because of that the delegation

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
of the task to someone else this something process champion can execute to make sure the process Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, clear for everyone?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then let's move to the next role. Must be administrated. This is a technical role. Basically, we need someone to make sure that IPP is running smoothly technically, which means all the interfaces are working fine. All the data jobs which are to be executed to make sure the data is available in IBP are running fine. There are no technical issues in terms of making sure that IBP is running. So he's the person who ensures the data.

 Suppose we are integrating with S4 HANA. This is digital, right? Digital team needs to be.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Agreed, agreed.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We are just identifying a separate role and then you can help us with whatever it is. Digital team will take it So Khalid, do you have any recommendation? Someone like Vignesh would be doing this for IVP as well?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let's discuss this. Just keep this point open. We'll discuss it internally. So we have a support contract and hypercare with you guys as well. So usually we need to have one team from the project who should be there supporting and probably with him, someone from our team.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This rules ensure that every month, whatever jobs required to execute process now, technically from a data perspective, from transaction perspective, are executing and there is no concern with those interfaces and the jobs.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You can put it This could be, say, this could be from the project team or from our team. For sure, we need from the project team here because we have a support contract and we have a hypercare, right? So initially, it should be from, and along with it, if there is anyone from our ad hoc, we'll put their name on. Yeah, of course, there will be a team from ORPA supporting all the massive data, but in the long term, Yeah, so we'll need to take that or some stability.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes, that's true. OK, so noted this one. This one noted.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
One more thing here.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Actually I have a doubt. Hello. Yes, yes, I hear in most of the responsibilities in the last meeting we provided a number of employees and number of managers and all in the center of scale perspective. We also have a no calendars right to include or to consider in discounting and no no.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
No, no, no, not agree on that until now because IBP is purely for inventory centralization project and we are the business owners and LNS is not part of our centralization so from governance perspective you are including them but we are not agreeing for them to use our system or even to take our scope.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Is not going to use by LNS?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
We did not agree on it and our management, our SVPs and everyone is not agreeing on this because they are not part of centralization of inventory. And they need to know this because I think they think that they are going to use IBP, which is not the case.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And we are getting signature from BPD and all from them. Khalid, you need to come from this place. Yeah, yeah, I need.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
I think we need to align on this part. Yes, and actually I was actually requesting several meetings from digital and excellence it. So I think it's a good idea to analyze this point, actually.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So good. Do it. What is the thank you? Okay. Okay.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Anyone other than the question or Kyle? Can we proceed? Do you have any other open points for discussion with this document?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes I had one open points, so we were discussing it last week. Um I Under drilling, we had a endorser. So there was an endorser role that would be involved in drilling. But we said that we would discuss this with yourself, Abdul, for confirmation on this role and who it would potentially be.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, drilling planner, isn't it? That's the equipment, OK?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this would be the equipment team. There is basically this for the demand planning isn't it. So basically what we are saying is demand planning there is a requirement to have two roles one is the planner second is the endorser who endorses this and then there's the manager who approves it. So this is something we've allied in MRO and chemicals we need this clarification that whether in drilling also will have similar structure where a demand planner will work on the drilling demand.

 Will there be an endorser or a reviewer role in drilling as well. So, the drilling manager or team leader. So, the drilling planner will be we have a equipment engineers, they will be take the planner role, then it will be endorsed by the team leader. So, anyhow so we have to align with the inducer department. So, you can put time being the inducer team will do both planning and endorsement.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Also, we need a number of planners from a demand side for drilling, tying, and the manager. We've taken this input in the last meeting, but we need this confirmation from you that considering there is a category-wise planner, we assume that there will be, since there are five categories for each EGC, there will be like five planners. Is this assumption correct, Abdul, on a headcount level? Be more and more.

 So can you help us with the headcount on a demand side for drilling? Okay, no problem. Khalid, can you just send an email so we will get it from the drilling team.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I was on another call, I just joined. Yeah, now I see the equipment, the engineers, which is the inducer department, so Rahul need the headcount for us all for the planning planner and then okay so so we will obtain officially so if you can send an email to me and Tashik so we'll coordinate with the drilling team and we'll call it okay Rahul you can send it to me I can send it to any exact exact title yes we will share the details what we need

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
to collect between me and Faith then we need this clarity for that we get confirmation of number of people involved from drilling side. Rahul also if you can just brief what will be the role a little bit more. Yes yes so there are three there are two roles we had originally identified one is a demand planner who is responsible for creating the drilling demand in IBP making sure the demand is correct analyzing the demand.

 Now the manager is essentially approving the demand but as per your suggestion we will have one more role in between which is kind of a team leader role which reviews the work done by the drilling planner it endorses it so that manager can approve it. So we have three levels. We put both option either the team leader can do the review and endorsement or we can put they can suggest for three layer.

 So that's the question. So probably then you will we'll put this as the open item in the question we sent to you so that you can confirm both whether there is an endorser role or not or whether the manager himself will endorse an approval. Exactly, so you can put it there and we'll get it and also whenever you make a little bit elaborate. Yeah yeah we'll do that so we'll elaborate the role we'll elaborate what would be the approval levels for each role and then how many people are involved in that role.

 We'll send that information. A question additionally to it is drilling and tying is part of the same business vertical, but we understand there are separate tying planners. From an approver perspective, whether the approvers of tying are also separate? Will we have a separate tying manager or drilling manager takes care of our tying demand as well?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
It's a separate definitely.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, it is separate.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Both are separate plans.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, the manager and the planner both are separate for time. Yes, yes, yes. OK, also for time. We are taken to planners. Is this correct number, Ashik? Like how many planners are there in time? Do we know this number?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Now we need to get from them, it's more than two.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then probably we'll send this along with drilling, we'll send this request for tying as well so that you guys can confirm the people involved from demand side for drilling and tying.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, no, see Rahul, just make it drilling and tying always separate. And also in Rahul, in tying, there's no any planning of equipments So what will be their role?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So their role is to make sure the demand is basically updated in IPP. So it would be much simpler role what we have discussed since we are not creating demand the way we are doing for drilling. So essentially their role will be limited to only uploading the time demand in IPP. So that the demand can be reconciled.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
OK, fine.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, and any other question?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, nothing from my side.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So thank you very much, everyone. We will send this email out to you Khalid to pass on to Abdul and Mohammed Ashique. And then we will take the rest of this forward in identifying the users across the business. So thank you very much for your time.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So he's asking. Then if we are all right, then let's conclude this call.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you everyone for your time. Thank you. Thank you.
