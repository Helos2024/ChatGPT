UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Vignesh. Bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good morning, good afternoon. Hello. Hi everyone. Hello. No more.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Happy New Year to whomever we didn't talk to before. I think that we didn't, yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Happy New Year.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Did you spend the New Year there? Yeah, I went back to Lebanon.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah. No, I left. He went back to Lebanon for a week.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I was seeing the New Year in Dubai, it was very impressive, the fireworks, the Burj Khalifa.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You went to New Year in Dubai?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I wish, I wish.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But for sure the fireworks was much better on on the way much better yeah very crowded there is there will be a stampede yeah that's the issue it's super packed like you you start up one day early and then

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
you leave the next day so so you stay there for the two days period for new year because they will close start closing the roads at around 12 o'clock in the afternoon itself to prepare for the Yeah, yeah, we

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
will need to be one day before there where we want to.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, otherwise you need to go there. You can roam around and then you and by the time this will finish it will be around 2-3 o'clock because the cars will not be allowed to go on the Sheikh Zayed Road. And they will park the cars long far away. So by the time the car reaches fireworks, it will be around 2-3 o'clock and if you want to come to Abu Dhabi, it will be around 5 o'clock in the morning.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
That's a pain, yeah. The best best newer is to celebrate at home.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Do not go anywhere.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
OK, we do not have Mohammed Ashik and Abdul. Abdul is in DND. He's presenting somewhere and By the way, Rahul, I have shared with Arjun.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't know when. I have shared with Arjun the SAP BOM model. OK, OK. I can paste it on the chat here also. You shared it over the chat?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I shared it over the chat.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That day, you remember, we were Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did share with him. Let me try to paste it on the chat here. Maybe you can refer to. Arjun Arun Arun is the I don't I don't. So let me. Let me put it on the chat over here so that you can at least if nobody is there, you can, you know, discuss that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
One minute.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I am putting it on the I put it on the Doesn't come here. Yeah. Now you can check it out. This on the chat.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, let me open this one.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I'll have to open throughout knock or threshold.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You are. Oh.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I'm just putting my credentials. It goes through the authentication.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Because it doesn't allow me to send mails to outside nowadays.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's it's blocking if I send it to your voice image.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Is it so you can send it on emails and that I can do.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Maybe I'll send it after you see this one. I'm not able to open this.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Let me see if I'm able to.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, I can open it if you want to see that it's open now for me. Yeah, OK, then you can share your screen.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, let me share my screen.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
typically what you guys have done.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We always show this because you share this with Arun.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
You already saw this then fine okay.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah this was very good last time when we were there with Arun.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So you have created this bill of materials. So the basically what we wanted to do today Vignesh was to give the demonstration of drilling demand planning solution based upon the data we have received and get the feedback. Additionally, align on some of the points which we think will need more clarity. But we don't have the Latif and the last week we were not able to do it because they were on vacation.

 And today we thought we'd be able to align them, but they are not available.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Khalid, we need some more.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday, reminders are not going to work, reminders are not going to work anymore, then let it be escalated.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Call it, let it be escalated.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, we've already mentioned this in our weekly status that we are waiting for participants availability for drilling.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Tomorrow and then we will call them actually.

Bastian Osorio:
In just a comment from my side, following following your your advice, vignesh we prepared the demo and we basically create a list of questions a very specific question regarding the data as you know the question are related to uh completion code additional completion code and mostly generic and and branded code so we have this question and we hope to share this question can you share can you can you show me the list of questions that you have because

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
see what for me is I want to also you know get an answer for this and I want to make that as a design decision which is yes we have shown the concept many times but sometime we have to you know ensure you know that we are accurate in I even in fact actually I have not in my in my PPT I have not shown the casing design you know because but in the EWDP they said casing design is one of the determining factors, but he doesn't show, but this where we need to.

 We need from them a clear clarity on on how we will determine this. We will make it as a design decision.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so these are some of the questions with the GoSTem team and us have put together so that we are able to take this conversion. So like if you look at the data they have shared the OCTG file and we see that field well type and completion code only are available here. From the casing design is not available. So we are assuming that these are the three attributes. We are saying, if there are any additional attributes to get unique bound, we need the confirmation of attribute.

 Second, the Excel sheet is only for OTCG. Now there are other categories as well, DC, liner, hanger.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Assumption is that whatever attributes we define will cover all the categories. It must. For me, for me, simple like this. If I have a combination, it should lead me to an equipment basket, which has all the components. I can have nested equipments also. I am not worried about that part. In the sense, in the SAP, you can have a component and a sub-component also, sub-item. It can be like that. I don't mind that, but that must be for one well, if I determine the bomb, it should have all the components from the planning till the completion except for the tie-ins.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So that's what we have mentioned here because the Excel sheet which we have received is only for OCTG, right?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So another thing is if you notice, see the thing is one more thing. In one of the discussion with one of the guys. Casing design was one of the factors and also category. OK, now this is another question that I had They said that the equipment basket will also determine be determined based on the category. That means if there is a new horizon, it will be different. If there is a plug and shut something they were saying, you know, that means the conference can be different.

 Is this category also going to be one of the parameters you put it? You know, just don't miss it.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Even if we put it, even if we put it like see in this example we have the category new horizon, but the quantity itself are not consistent. Like It is 1010142414, so our assumption is that if we are able to put a filter on field well type and at least the quantities for the metal identified should be consistent, right?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The thing is, notice you know the first three are lower the comb OK and still the first three are lower the comb 101014. No, no, I think you're missing the gray gray one. Yeah, all the US whom shape are 14 OK, but lower the comb. Again it is. It is changing. Yeah, you're right. It is changing for what reasons. I don't know. Yeah, so he fought for us to define bomb.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
We need a list of letters and the quantity of the materials. If any of these changes will not be able to define bomb and if we are not able to define bomb will not be able to forecast the relaying material.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It can be again. I think what we need to tell them is see you have a bomb with the proposed quantity. After that, if you change that, that is fine. That is your demand review. And then you are changing it like this. It is fine. But we need in the bombs quantities to be proposed for the way you review it. And then you take the decision, OK, for this one, maybe I don't need 10 pieces. I don't need 14.

 Maybe I can do with 10.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
That's what we need to tell them. Correct. You're correct. Exactly. So that's one point. Then the second point is that here we do not have anything related to additional completion code. So from the example you shared in the PPT, which you shared, the additional completion code can be an additional bomb, right? So you have one bomb, which is the main bomb, and the second bomb is additional completion code.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But we need to- Not an additional completion code. What they were trying to say is during the TWDP system, They were trying to say that, I have the recording of that entire session also. They are saying that from the, say for example, there is a lower vacuum, water injector, completion code 2B. Now there is a main bomb will be determined based on these parameters, the well type, the lower vacuum and then the completion code 2B.

 But they are saying that after that also, there may be some components which are required and that was like an another basket. Basket additional additional basket, so that is why you know we can tell them this is the additional bomb. Each bit is required as a proposal. You know it can be changed, but I saw that in their demo. That's why I have created it like this.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, and that's what even I saw the same, but the only thing is we do not have the visibility of additional completion code in the data shared. We would like to have that visibility and how many additional completion codes are there per. Completion code because there is this optional nature which means you can select multiple additional completion codes for a single completion code.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is something we need to check with them. You are right.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
We do not have the data itself to even look at how the additional codes are established. That's the second point. The third point, we looked at the custom table which was provided to us. And if we look at these other SAP codes, we are not able to establish the relation between the branded material and alternate material. So to give you an example, there are close to 110 materials in this Excel sheet, out of which we could find only around 12 materials, 12 or 15 materials in this custom table, which means and also there is like many to one to many is fine because you have one branded material and you have four alternate materials.

 But this is not clear whether this is a branded material or unique material or generic material. So this relationship between the generic material and the branded material is not clearly established in this custom table.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If that is the case, then they may need to do some data cleansing if it is required from Yeah, I I did share one deck with you. I am not too sure you know if you have gone through that. That that that deck so they they will need to. Do all these activities. I'll put that also. I'm not too sure if everybody here has seen it. I think I think college did. Data stream. This is the one which I pasted it on the chat.

 So here they see our job will be to extract the data and give it to them. Then they will need to compare it with the EWDP and any other legacy system. If it is not, they need to construct the master data to be loaded and also load the constructed data. When I say constructed data over here, It means you know what is not available, which is manually and I said specifically that includes material master as well as generic to actual or alternate mapping because I know that that table

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
itself is not.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Really up to date now if the table is not up to date, then the determination will fail. Right, so this this sort of thing I I have. I will put the PPT also over here. Or in case you will need it, you can. Use this to drive the data stream.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Here.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, these are some of the points we need to drive.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
What is the third point?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I second point is OK. What is the third point?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
The second point was the additional and completion code. And the third point was this mapping, grounded versus generic codes. The content of the table is not sufficient. So this is what is now, we need clarity as well as we would like to demonstrate on what we have built upon. So there are two things which we need. Immediate input from the DeLink team is one on this open questions on data requirement.

 And the second is the demonstration we have prepared so that we can align with the team on the solution in terms of demonstration and the data in terms of the questions we have on data.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, but a comment from my side. Of course, these questions are pretty fast to be answered. If they give us the input information, we will be able to make a way more deep and a more comprehensive demo. It will be great if they can share the answer with us, so then we can adapt the demo to address these points and make the demo way more complete. We just need to make sense of it. And the only way to make sense of it is by answering these questions.

 Yeah, we need an answer to all these questions, right?

Naamani, Mohamad:
So yeah, I mean in this case also Khalid and Vignesh. So I agree with what you said. We need to push a bit or escalate because so far they had a couple of concerns. They said we gave you the data in September. Now we've analyzed it. We've also made sure that from a drilling industry perspective, we are aware of all the different details, but also we need their input. So, I think we need, what would be the best way?

 I'm suggesting something, Dr Bastian and the team, let me know if it makes sense. Is all this info in the BPD document that we're waiting on the final feedback and approval. The reason I'm asking is, can we post those questions or comments in the document itself? See, the thing is, Mohamed... Where we need their input, and then send an email saying, dear drilling team, we've been waiting for your feedback.

 We've highlighted in the attached document some points we need your answer on, which are the following. We can have them in the document, but also list them in the email, and copy everyone else.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Moment the BPD is a little higher level document compared to what we are discussing BPD is meant to show basically the activities you know which are going to be performed but now we are at the level below that one so if you try to combine that with the BP probably these are going to be you know which document will will have this level of detail it will be something like your configuration dash rational or something like that.

 Or configuration rational whatever it is you know. The thing is if you input all these into drilling then they will come and ask why is this not there in the other documents.

Naamani, Mohamad:
No no you're right actually this is why I was asking about the level of details. So to your point we can actually send it only by email saying in addition to the so as we prepare for the configuration we need your help on the that we wanted to understand during the technical meeting. However, we didn't have any representative. As you said, we shouldn't be now shy about highlighting that this is late because I think team correct me if I'm wrong.

 This is I mean this week and I think. Also last week they were not available for any feedback.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We need to get them into the call if they are not, you know, participating. I think all of the weekend involvement. You know that matter.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, yeah, I think we can send an email immediately.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See the problem here is what I see and I don't know whether to say this or because we even what ability and Ashik they are telling us is not what exactly the EWDP teams and if say for example, from the drilling drilling business when they come because when they when Abdulateeb and generally they say well type completion code field okay this is what we do but when we look at the EWDP system then we see that oh for a well completion there are job types for the job types there are there are a lot of details which they show for me I don't want to reach out to 10 different parties for us their job is to come back to us saying that we already make a proposal we make a design.

 Now for me if there are four parameters or ten parameters I need to determine an equipment basket or a bomb and under the bomb I can have all the equipments I can have sub items also if that is required but that bomb must be complete okay. I can have one main bomb one additional bomb if required this is what they were showing on that day but now that is not clear The design of the bomb itself is not clear to us.



Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let me check with Abdul and maybe we need to have a focus session with them sometime tomorrow. Can I suggest the following?

Naamani, Mohamad:
Because we're losing time and as you noticed Khalid, we're already now doing a re-baseline of the plan. So these are critical things and some of the stakeholders might not know the impact of such delays on the overall plan. As Inesh mentioned at the beginning, they want us to go faster and to expedite, but at the same time, the feedback we need from them is not received quickly. So can we send an email based on today's session?

 So it could be a reply on this invite saying, dear Latif and Arshik, telling them, as we reviewed and we're working on basically we're preparing for the configuration. We have the following questions that we needed your urgent response on, where you could also align with the link team stakeholders to give us this input and list those questions. We need to have everyone copied, definitely you, Asma and Firas, so they understand that we've been waiting and we need this input And then if you contact the Latif on chat, you can tell him we sent an email, we need your help, etc.

 But we need to have this on record, honestly.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah. OK. Yeah, I think this is fine. Yeah, yeah. And also call me Khalifa, Khalifa Al-Yafi. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, everyone you see fit.

Naamani, Mohamad:
And I think from our side, Rahul and the team can give you those questions. But I think coming from you, Khalid, would be better. Based on this invite or this session that we have saying we wanted your input. Since no one attended, these are the key questions we need urgently.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, OK, it doesn't matter. It comes from me or from you. It's OK.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Now I'm thinking more from an how official it is. We're happy to draft the email, but I think it should come from you. So that they also see it. A typical request, it's basically there are certain things that are linked. Rahul, I think you can work with Khalid on the wording and what are the questions, right?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, yeah, we have the draft ready.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Probably I can send that to Khalid and then we can take it forward. Yeah, let's do this. If you don't mind. Ashiq has joined.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
You have any questions for Ashiq? As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ashiq, hi.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
As-Salaam-Alaikum, hi. How are you? I'm trying to pull in the Latif also. So the team has some questions the drilling design and data. So we are going to draft an email and send you a list of questions on that. But if you can answer something here, if you have time now.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, sure.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, sure.

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
We can do that.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Let me share my screen again. So these are some of the questions we have. Now, Abdul had shared us the file from OCTG material, and now we can see there are a few concerns. One is that this file only highlights the field, weld type, and completion code as the key attributes, based upon the combination of which we'll be able to identify the materials for a specific weld. Now, in one of the previous discussions, we also had casing design as one of the inputs, and then there were other inputs.

 So, we need this information on what are those.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sometimes we sometimes we heard that you know the category you know determines the equipment basket. For example, one of the persons in the EWDP meeting was saying that if the category is new, then it will be different. If it's plugged and shut, it will. The bomb could be different. Another person during the previous meetings also said that casing design also influences components of the bomb. So we need to know at last you know our objective is to determine a bomb and under that bomb we have all the components including your except for your tie-ins it must have all the items from your planning to completion of the of the well.

 So but we don't find in the excel sheets that are provided this sort of information even when we looked at the materials it's not having I do not see any wellhead or anything anywhere. So we need what is the parameter to determine the bomb.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Now see regarding such kind of planning we are not directly involved in such kind of planning. So when we have some kind of technique questions regarding the planning and detail I mean we have an overview of the information. It is better to include the end user dealing who actually are involved in this planning who can answer these questions.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, correct, but we need your support in order to be a focal point and you need to conclude. You need to conclude with your drilling business and come to us saying that this is the bomb. It's not going to work if you say, okay, you contact them. Yes, we contacted them and these are our observations, but you are the owner of the system design, right? You need to come to us. You can have a meeting with And you can also invite us for the meeting if you need.

 We are more than happy to, you know, part of this, but we need a conclusion on what are the factors.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, so it's if maybe what you're conveying to me, maybe I cannot convey the same way to them, so it's better we have it in the same meeting that we have. Whatever question that is related to the planning site, we have it together.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
who is required to make this decision. Because if you see, because this is where we have also noticed it multiple times that when we have some questions, we when we connect with the EWDP team, they say something, something slightly different from what we hear and there is some other business people. They say something. They say that there is multiple Excel's, one for OCTG, one for some others. These sort of things we should know because we are in the build phase.

 We need to build a system. We cannot go on assumption. So if you want, we have one more meeting and we need a conclusion on this, Ashik. Because on one side, your management is pushing for an accelerated sort of delivery.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
And if we don't, then we are not able to promise anything that's one point Ashik another is this additional completion codes the data provided does not have any information additional completion codes so we need to know the details of there are how how the additional completion codes behave because there is one main completion code and then there are multiple additional completion codes and then this completion codes are optional nature which means one or one more than one completion codes for a single completion code additional completion code can be selected right so for the solution to design we need details of both completion codes and additional completion code so that we can define the bill of material right now the data provided does not have anything related to additional completion code and the last question is regarding the mapping between the branded and generic codes so the data which we received has around 110 materials of strategy but if we look at our table mapping table in S4 HANA we can only see like less than 20 materials mapped there so we need this confirmation on at least for the for the sake of build if we can get a sample data in terms of correct generic code and branded codes for for one bill of metal we'll be able to simulate that and build the solution around it it while the business team can work on cleaning the data and making the data updated in S4, updating the data in S4.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So that's where we need more clarity and we wanted to have this conversation last week only but we did not have any availability last week so that's where now this week we wanted to have this conversation today but yeah this is something which is becoming really urgent for us now.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So if if you want to send an email, I can send an IELTS forward to the users to get the information.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
OK, so then probably as as part of this discussion, I'll send this details over the email. Back to this meeting or we call it will connect and will send this email. So I think then when when we can have this confirmation, will it be possible to get these details over the email or you expect not to say no, no, no If you send an email, I don't know if that

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
will be just somebody will reply. You probably people may not understand fully also where we are coming from What is our requirement?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So if we are not sure, this is an official answer. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, in such meeting if we know what is actually the agenda requirements so we could in advance forward these meeting requests to the end user as well so that they could. Got the answers right now.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, we will. We can. That is that is that is a valid point from Aashiq. We will basically we want answers. Yeah, yeah. Proposed agenda and the questions also.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
OK, so then we'll send this questions and the agenda is to discuss about this questions and then to use this information to demonstrate eventually the solution in IPP is what we would like to do. But then when when can we have this conversation Ashik. If we are able to send the details today by email.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
I will send the email today right down to them and we'll see or else.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Then email and then follow up with the meeting.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Is this something we can have it tomorrow?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
I'm on leave next three days. Abdul will be here. We can.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, we need.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let me let me pull in Abdul. I see him green, so let me pull him. Nashik, you will check with the onshore guys or both onshore offshore?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
I'll check with the onshore guys. Yeah, Abdul is here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello Abdul.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Sorry, I was stuck with another meeting. Yeah. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How are you?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We need your, uh, your support.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This, uh, drilling.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there are a couple of questions from the team. And we asked Ashik and Ashik was saying that you need to check with the end user. And he's on leave the next three days. But this is something which the team is working on. And we need answers as soon as possible.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So we need your support. So based upon the data you shared, Abdul, Data has the OCTG metal allocation plan. And then we need final confirmation on what are different attributes which can be used to determine all the materials of drilling, right from well head, DC, liner, hangers, cementing, right from well planning till well completion, what all the metals which are required for planning a single well.

 We need the confirmation of different attributes, of which will be able to determine BOM. Because this sheet has a field, well type and completion code. There is category but it does not have casing ID. In some of the discussions we also discussed casing ID. So we need this final confirmation on the attributes, the combination of which will be able to have the bill of material for the entire well for all the different categories.



Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Rahul, as we discussed last time did you prepare the template as we discussed and to convert this one what can you just show that template I use the template and that template we will make it clear so see this we don't want to again go to the same room see so you just convert the template and put this columns and we can obtain the values here.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
One thing is obtaining the values. Second thing is that the critical attributes. We also need confirmation of attributes now.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think Rahul, can you show him the bomb? First of all, can you show him the bomb?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
No, no, no. Sorry, before that last time what we agreed even the OSM team, they agreed that they will convert the particular sheet to the the template yes so we have that can you share that one so we can let's go through

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
these questions and then we'll right away share the template as well so this is first question okay the second question is related to additional completion codes now the data you shared does not have anything related to additional completion code

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
that doesn't tell him whatever you put it as a column there and we'll obtain the data so now the so far we didn't reach to any template and put the template we can if applicable the additional completion code is not applicable for the all the items. And all different different criteria to make a bomb for OCTG 1 criteria and DCE different one and these are the things is this to understand this one at least we want to start from scratch and we want to build a template then from that template we can derive all this information So if you put this one, this question will not arise.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The simply.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
This question will still arise because the point we're trying.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The thing is, you show the template on why you want to take it that way.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Show the template and then discuss it. You're asking at the last question, but you didn't start the process actually.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
No, no, we started the process. Let me share you the template best.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Will you be able to share the Yes, I'm opening the data where those gaps are. Yeah. Yes.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is just this way.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It would be me. Give me a second. I will open the sure.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes. Can you see my screen?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. So this is IVP, OK? OK.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So first, we created the BOM. The BOM is a set, field, field, well type, and completion code. In this case, we have two completion code.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
not this one I am requesting the conversion of the the provided sheet to a template this is collection purpose this is this is the information that is in the template to the IVP template what we are telling see to understand the user better to convert their template to the understandable template Then we can fill into the the complete details. What are the missing one?

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is this is exactly what you're saying.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
No, see now here we have the the concession and now this if you bring the the material number and the quantity everything the row field. Then it will be the data fielding template. There you can see some grouping then you can find it we can derive from the OCTG itself there's some certain like a bill of material as well so here for example we have uh the material number okay this is

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
the so this is the bomb with the with the quantity and that this is what we are saying for for example the to be okay I have 14 okay okay but if I go if I go here for this material I have 14 but also have 10 I have 2 so I don't know which is I put 14 because it was the most repeated amount but that doesn't mean it's the right amount because in some cases for this

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
did you consider the category as well there is a new well and floated recovery and work oh yeah so if you can you filter the new new only new then it will trim down the quantity then quantitative fluctuation will trim see yeah I hear this is just one one category we have to 14 and 10 yeah 2 and 14 and 10 so the majority 10 so 14 so they're adjusting the quantity this is what we requested actually so some time they want to adjust to 10 or 2 so the majority is 14 isn't it yeah that's what it is to they can they can do it okay 14 14 okay and the material ID so said okay fine the problem so if you go this okay so we should put 14 the most reputed amount exactly so since the most reputed amount 14 and so what are the considered now the columns so better see if you can show them the same table and put it in the column then we can collect all the data from the drilling site.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, so you can also show the well head well plan right where we have all those attributes of the well which we are using for determining the bow. I think I think you know Rahul what Abdul is actually referring to is what we have done you know in the in the SAP he just looking for a template of of that Rahul.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Abdul can you hear me?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
One second maybe I'll share my screen what we can Hello.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello.

Naamani, Mohamad:
We're waiting for.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I'll just.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
I am just trying to convert okay so this is what I just copied from this table okay you can see my screen is it. Yeah, now you can see.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So this is the main table.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
This is what we shared, isn't it? You can see my screen, isn't it?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yes, we can.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Now, see, now what I, so what we have to see now, this is the, as per them, these are characters they provided. And now, this is the particular material number here. Serial number and so we have this much quantity so what we can do from this one these are the current catches available the start date end date the this mainly for the OCDG so second type I deleted okay so actually this all same material number the same material and different codes and it will be on unique material number for these items so So you can see the particular some items they allocated this number somewhere else they allocated this number.

 So once we fill into this what we can give them this is on template what we are proposing now and then now it will come the material number which is the word they used on 43 we can put this

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
material number so on. Abdul this way of filling the template like this. You know is going to be very difficult and also why we why we don't bring the materials into the rows of the Latif say for example of the Latif my no no let me I we already you know do

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
it like this one for example yeah it's the rows coming now so then what I'm going to do now see with this old whatever they mentioned here we will put it in the rows so this is the material number

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
they'll bring in the rows and so this many wells they're going to use this material number okay uh I think there is a there is a slight you know difference in what we are asking can I can I share my screen one minute okay okay see no see no probably are you able to see my screen yeah Can you see my screen now? See, Abdul, what we are, what we plan to do is, you see, we are going to have one equipment basket.

 See, 122 is an equipment basket and attribute, one of the attribute is lower the cum. This is for lower the cum water injector 2B and you know, you have given main bomb. Now, what is inside this? The data collection template will be like this. For the 122, which is the equipment basket, for this combination, lower vacuum, water injector well, completion code 2B, these are all going to be the components.

 You see these materials. The example over here consists of your Christmas tree, your pub joints, casing, valves, plugs, liner hanger, If you see this example, what we ideally want to have is, if I am going to have this combination, lower the comb, water injector, 2B. This is what we know now. The question that the team is asking is, yes, I agree with you. This is the template we will have to give you, and you will give us for this material, this many quantity, this material, this many quantity.

 For example, lower the comb, it will be like this. For upper the comb, This will be like this. But if you see the number of items, the quantity may change. See here, for upper zakum, lower zakum, this is 1 and 20. In the lower zakum, it may be 1 and 10. See, that can change based on whatever criteria. But what we will do, the template is easy. But what they are trying to ask is, now in order for me to determine this equipment basket, I will take one is the that is lower the codes.

 Well type, which is water injector completion code, which is to be now. Do we need to consider the category which is saying new horizon shut and plug? That is one question whether we should consider the category and also in one of the meetings there was something called as a casing design. Now now if that is going to be the case, whatever you are saying we will do. But what will happen is in addition to that field well type completion code, There will be casing design and whatever category for that.

 We will have all the materials for that well. This is what we are trying to understand. Ultimately, the BOM or the data collection template which you are saying will look like this. These are the materials, these are the components, quantities which are required for this combination. This is what you are trying to do in that Excel sheet. This will come, but what they are trying to ask here is, these three lower vacuum water injector 2B, currently we know, at least this is what we understand.

 There were in few conversations, they have told somebody from the EWDP when we see, they are saying casing design is one of them. Then when we met with another business user, he said that category because he said that maybe some weld, if they are going to open and shut it, then they will have the components as different because they are not going to complete it right away, they may complete it later.

 So we want to know what are first the parameters, speed, welded completion, casing design, and category. Is that okay? Once you tell that, we give the template for data collection like this. You will have for this one, these are the materials, these are the quantities, and this will happen. Again, now Rahul, you can add if you If you agree or if you want to add anything or anybody wants.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I agree this is what the first question which we have. I was showing is related to that. What are different categories is what we want to consider along with what Vignesh has mentioned. That's the that's the question. Even before we say that these are the materials for those combination.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Ultimately, if you see this now, let me show you this. This way of grouping for the SAP, assume that you are going to. So we will create a BOM group called water injector. Now water injector itself, you have a BOM for lower ZAKUM, upper ZAKUM, you have additional main, whatever. But if you see this, if you see the BOM group water injector, you can see, you see this first and you can see in the BOM1, maybe it is there, BOM2 it is not there.

 So what is the quantity? Once you tell us what are the features, we will just give you the template to load exactly what you are showing in the Excel sheet. Row-wise, column-wise is converted into row here, you see. We need from the row the quantity and the unit of UOM so that we can upload a equipment basket or a BOM for this combination. Because see, the thing is why we are insisting on this, you know why we are interested, because whatever when we saw the EWDP system quite frankly, first you know they said that field job type, you know again they said job type and completion code.

 Then when we went to the EWDP system, session, it was job type plus field gave a face and in the face there was a bomb. See, I have the recording also of that entire screen and then they said that casing design is one of the parameters. So there are many variables which we have now. So we just want to ensure that we have one list of combinations which we And here, when that combination is met in that bomb, I should have all the components, like for example, planning items, completion items, Christmas tree, everything, cementing, accessories, or liner hangers, whatever it should be over here.

 We can have subcomponents, that is possible for us, but that's even more going to be a little difficult more for the business rather. So to keep it simple, this bomb, if there is a well to be drilled, list on all the components, list on all the quantity. Now, this is the first phase. Now, after this is done, what they are going to do, this is for the demand. All these probably are generic items of the Latif.

 Now, when they are going to, based on the, there are two inputs now to the IBP. One is your drilling bar chart plan, which will tell you the start date, end date, well, which will be drilled. And this information will tell the IVP for drilling that well what are the components which are required. These are probably going to be all your generic components. Now for the planning team they can assess it and they can see okay these are the components and like what you have just said they may change the 14 into a 10 or a 14 into a 2 that is fine they can change the demand.

 Once they change the demand when it comes to supply there is the second data that we are going to rely upon. What is that? There is a table between generic items to specific items. In that table, you need to have for the generic item, this is the specific item. If again that data also, probably at the time we go live, if it is not maintained, then the supply planning may go long. These all we have planned.

 That is what you know the second question that that Rahul was saying yes I have some items we did look up into that generic table which is there in the SAP but we found only entries for three of the

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
items so that table also will will be come important in the supply planning.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
If you have any questions or if you have any thing that we need to consider you please let us know exactly now what what I proposed last time so now we have full plan so now the material quantity so I share my screen yeah see okay my screen isn't it okay no no we cannot I cannot see yeah now we can see yes yeah now see what I'm proposing here maybe it's correct or wrong so we can make you see now they provide the complete plan okay the the month by month or day by day like this plan they provided and so this is the quantity and material number the now what I have done now here so I taken on 1338 concept so we can get them they get us so this one see all 1338 taken and the different quantity and the different well so once we finalize this one this all the quantity this particular one item actually so there are the 38,992 this is our plan so this one now How we are going to meet this plan?

 We want to see see the now these are different quantities available in different stages Okay, and different combination and the there will be the how many three type of three material numbers? So the basically then once we mention here the unique number so the unique number it will be same for all Okay, this is one material and this is the full plan we have up to maybe 2026 we have 25 and 26 26 year full yeah so what you are trying to show you yeah go ahead Abdul yeah the two-year plan we have so we want to see at least that we can use this one and we can populate as is this is the plan this is the So therefore information available here.

 Yeah, correct, but ability if the question here is you.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You are partly you know doing some data plus you are also doing partly what IDC is supposed you know to do now. If assume that we give a template ability, assume that we give a template exactly this column A2 column. K. This is your. This is you're going to be your head us right? What you are telling is you.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
See now we want to see that this is the final table we have from here. I want to build the reverse way. This is the final what we are approaching. This is the final deliverable from IBP. The like will get how many quantity required each month from each commodity.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, that will come that that is what IBP supposed to do.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Now we have the final one already, and you said they provided so we can go reverse way to build our structure. This is what my proposal actually. So this is.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We already have right structure is the column number one row number one in this case. The row number one is the structure data will need to be provided by you. I mean we can for that one sheet which was there. Maybe they are. They are trying to make you know a sample again. It is not a complete one that they are trying to make, but I think they have taken some some sample and they have because last time we said that for the thing we need to demonstrate a sample to the

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
business, right? We don't need for the entire data for all all the period. We just need one will. The entire data set all the materials for each one offshore and one onshore onshore.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Currently, offshore and also they for two years minimum. So obtain this one and put it in the format if you can just pair someone then we can tell them we can guide them how to do it and they will build the data for the entire item for two

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
years.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
So from that we can develop the later on the stage.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So what I think what you are trying to say is Abdul are you asking this team to do the data work of constructing this data. This is what you're trying to say. This is what you're asking. Sorry, I was not understanding for you.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, once we've done this data. Then we can use the same data for the initial planning, isn't it?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So Rahul, in other words, what he is trying to tell is he's saying that you you have to be like a based on the data that he has provided. You are going to build, you know the entire data, but my understanding was different. Was not like this. That's why I was repeatedly asking. The ability in the in the one year P OK when we got the data into the system. The data is the responsibility. You know they have the business right?

 From their source system. What is the data? What is the quantity on stock on hand stock in the in the template that we provide, right? So the template is up to us. We will provide the template and they give the data in the template. If it's a system or in case they don't have a system, they will construct the data as per the template that we are giving. Now you are asking that legacy extraction.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, yeah, no legacy at all.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I'm telling at least so this one the planning that can provide and so so we have understanding is Abdul wants us to use the existing templates and pull up the entire data and from the data work towards defining the

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
template other way around yeah after that so we can build at least so we get the their item and so the the complete for two years they have and we can put it in the year you provided is only for one OTCG only once we fix this template so we can collect the we can agree this the way forward to the end user then the all the items that we have the record map so there are two things

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
are relative one is template based on the data you have provided but this cannot be final template because if we have to upload data in SAP the templates would be from SAP but for us to even finalize on to upload defined templates for uploading data in SAP. First we need to at least have couple of sample well data completely so that we understand what is the data to for us to define template. Now what the sample data you provided is only for one.

 Now what you're saying is based upon the sample data finalized template and based on the template.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no, no, no Look, for example, I'll give you an example. There's plenty of categories here. There were sorry completion codes. There are blank or they have symbols. How we can allow that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, there's some telling.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
See once we've done this one, all the this data issues we can sit with the team and we can so we can alliance with the team.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this is exactly what we're asking. Sorry ability. This is exactly questions that we have. We cannot build the system without having this definition. I think we are going the other way around. Like we have in multiple cases, we have blank completion codes. We don't have a clear definition for additional completion code. So for us, it's hard to, of course, upload everything into the templates if we don't have clear definitions, because it's not It's not that straightforward.

 We need clear definitions and based on that we cannot build the system.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Not load everything and then based on that build.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
OK, so once we see the completion here, we want to check with the dealing user whether the sometime we want to see whether completion code is not mandatory. With them actually so they put it here so at least what we can do if you can provide me like this template and so is it okay like this we can collect the data and we can put whatever the like additional parameter here we can add for example casing design isn't it the onshore they want to casing design then one more parameter Ignatius I think Ignatius is on hold yeah casing design and we have one more thing at the time so this completion type this one completion completion code addition completion okay addition code.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So anything else here?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
So, what I do, I will check with, I do one thing, I will try to complete the OCTG. And I'll share with the end user. So I've taken their opinion as well. Then, like commodity, commodity will finish it. Only four or five tables at the end.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's great. Thank you. One more question. You have the material here. This material, is the generic or is it the branded code? The branded. The generic.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Yeah.

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If you can put the generic, because we checking the date in the in the table in SAP and we couldn't find find a generic one yeah now see the generic not updated there so we have to update so anyhow

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
so we will build that one generic so these are the information we have to capture so now like this I will try to complete the and we need the description as well to know to the user At least major commodity if you complete like this, then then we can move forward and from here we can tell them which are the parameter to be considered for the

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bob. Then that will help us.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
When do you think Abdul if we can like the end user will be able to confirm this data with us?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
so I can continue this one I can complete by tomorrow I'll share with them by tomorrow let's see yeah we can connect them on Thursday or Friday at least we'll see the way forward and if it's okay then we can continue with so I so we can have the end user along with the end user on Thursday 9th. So so we have the same session on Thursday again.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
123 we can utilize this session and extend the invite to the end users as well. One more question here.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Abdul what we are doing right now is offshore, right? So for answer also this would be same or there will be another set of data for answer.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yes, no set of data. Onshore and this would be same structure.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So what? The data would change based upon the onshore materials or nomenclature, but the structure would be same as what you're saying, exactly. OK, so then. Let's let's align, so let's let's communicate this to end user ability.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
We will will forward you the for Thursday as well and then if you can forward the invite for Thursday to end users. Based upon that we can then try to get all the clarity on data by Thursday and if we are able to get all the clarity on data by Thursday we will incorporate that into IBP and then we can provide the demonstration of this solution to you.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
thing so yeah this is the same thing I'll show you see once we're done with OCTG currently we are receiving this is the table from the supplier actually the VMI vendor they are also doing the You can see my

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
screen, isn't it? Yeah.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
yeah just for information this is the one received from supplier so the same material how they plan so they are keeping this much stock and this comes to the not usable stock and this is the plan so this is the one the same data they're putting December 24, 25, the January this is supply planning right this is kind of supply planning and this is derived from the demand actually the demand which is same Yeah, so yeah, for us

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
also, first, we'll have to make sure we are able to finalize the demand. We are able to define bill of material. And once we are able to finalize the demand with the bill of material, for sure we'll be able to do the supply planning based on the attributes you are mentioning here. But then before we jump to supply planning, we'll have to make sure that demand is finalized in IBP. And we are able to define the bill of materialness for HANA.

 That's the first and most important step because this is the most complicated thing which we need to finish upon.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Supply planning will be able to do it as we proceed. OK. OK, so I'll sit with the end user tomorrow, so maybe I should. I should hear all this.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, but then I shake is on leave tomorrow. So probably we'll need your support for both onshore and offshore.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, Abdul can support me. Yeah, I'm here. So you can support. So at least to see we go commodity with commodity that what we have planned now.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So then we can try to convert and we can convince the industry. Yeah. OK, just one more thing. Abdul when you're preparing, just make sure we the data also has power. Additional completion code you you added the column but then yeah wherever it is applicable if you can highlight that that would be great so that that way we know that additional completion code how many additional completion codes are part

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
of the example and how we define the bill of material for additional completion codes as well exactly so the this the this the three additional case in design initial completion code I have field now field well type category. Anything else? Yeah, so that's it. Then let's connect on Thursday.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Tomorrow you will work internally and prepare the data and Thursday we can review the data along with end users. And if if that helps us clarify all the question, Hector Palacios will be good, right? Then this will this will help us take it forward. Anyone have any other question for Abdul, Abdul or Mohammad Ashik?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So Rahul, the list of questions which you have prepared, have you got the answers or this is the one what Abdul is going to?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So Abdul is going to prepare the data is what and then the data would be reviewed with any other. So Abdul, what I'll do is I'll also send you the questions what we are looking for so that while you're preparing the data you can you can be aligned on the questions what we are having so that when the

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
data is prepared on Thursday the questions will get answered along with the data. OK, OK, and for Thursday session so we will ask will in forward the invitation to the end users, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, so we'll focus commodity by commodity, isn't it? We'll finish OCTG, then we'll move better.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
On Thursday, we'll have for all the commodities or you're planning to have only one commodity?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, first commodity will finish OCTG, then we can move to valid, so on.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
But the expectation here would be that the same template would be applicable irrespective of commodity.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
yeah doesn't really see now if any additional field is coming so by commodity commodity then we can finalize at the end so we'll have in this case three or four sessions to complete the or the plan so template will

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
remain same only will be like by commodity there could be some specific fields for that commodity right exactly so we can get more clarity and we will get to the all the engines are on board and they can explain

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
their business correctly.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Okay, so to summarize our call, we will share the details of the questions on email to Abdul and then based upon that you guys will work internally tomorrow with the end users, prepare data for us and then on Thursday we'll have call to review the questions and review data with end users and if there are any other further questions or then users on Thursday.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So for Thursday only OCTG, right? Yeah, OCTG. Bastian, Hector, Sagar.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Anyone have any other question Kunal? Open. From our open points we did. We do have two three items. One was the lead time calculation to understand the lead time calculation and the other was tie in. If time permits, I think we can discuss that as well and close it.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yes, we do have around half an hour in today's call, so you want to pull up that list quickly so that we can.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
On those points.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let me know if you can see my screen.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So Abdul and Mohammad Ashiq, we discussed about multiple lead times in the end-to-end process, right? We said there are multiple lead times to be defined. So we need to align on where these lead times are captured today. Is there a way for us to capture this lead time from system anywhere? The lead time between, say, vendor VMI and AdNoc, or lead time between the time required to convert from PR to PO, PO to PR to call of agreement.

 So if you remember in the end-to-end process, we have four or five different lead times we've identified. So we wanted this clarity on different lead times and how to capture, or from where we can get this information It will be better if we maintain it in some fields.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So because at the moment we don't have it as in any kind of field within the contract. So maybe we need to define it in some specific field for different categories of items.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So what you're saying is this this lead times are not maintained anywhere in any system?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, not from any field. You may have it in the contract. Within the context documents or within the text fields. So it's not readily available where you can really access and read it. So maybe you'll have to maintain it in some field within the system based on category.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Do we have it at least on Excel or some Excel file?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, Excel we can provide. Yes, we can develop and we can provide it to you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So then Hector, if we go back all different lead times in Excel will be able to maintain it in IBP?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, for sure. Then we need to define in parallel where we are going to store that. Because in the future for the maintenance purpose, we need to have a clear source. Otherwise, whenever we have new combinations, we are not going to have the lead time. But for uploading to a system, if they can share the Excel with us, we can start from there. And if we have any questions, we can bring the questions like we are doing right now.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
okay so then with this today's discussion this this resolves the point right we will be able to get the data in Excel so just let's update this and close this point then and we'll get the data in Excel form

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. The next one we have. Yeah, yeah, good.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The next one we have about about the staggered delivery. This was again something that we discussed in the previous meetings. An example for is where you have an agreement and the vendor instead of delivering all quantities at the same time goes to distribute and says instead of 30 quantity in the first month and 30 in the second, we do 60 quantities in the second month altogether. So what we wanted to understand was where you're capturing this information and And what can what can be the source that we use to pull it into IBP?

 We did discuss last time that this information is getting updated on the purchase order from window. If we can agree and confirm on this, then we can close this point as well.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
This is a on the contract level. What is being the what is the lot for each delivery? This is what the request is.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So, Mohamed Ashiq, if you remember in one of the conversations in the supply planning, you discussed that the supply plan is say of 200 quantity, but a vendor may not provide all the 200 quantity at once. And he may give us feedback that the delivery would be staggered in a different fashion than what is required, right? So, you have a proposal to a vendor and vendor confirms back a supply plan to you, which can be different than your original proposal.

 So, where are you capturing this information? Is it updated in purchase order or is it updated in Ariba where vendor is able to confirm in Ariba? Are your vendors using Ariba so that we can extract that confirmation of vendor on the request AdNoc has provided and update the IBP?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, we don't have it in the system because now we are doing it manual planning, supply chain review. So it is maintained within the Excel sheet where the staggered deliveries and load sizing is maintained there.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So how do you get this input from vendor then? Does he communicate back to your email?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Does he communicate back to your phone? How does the vendor tell you that? Since that review sheet is jointly developed, so the vendors themselves update the sheet on the delivery schedule.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
They have access to your planning sheets? Vendor has access to your... So when it comes to IVP, will the same be happening? Access to IBP to update their supply?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, if you have options, I mean, we will receive it in Excel sheet. So if we can distribute it within that cloud sizing based on the Excel sheet, it will be required.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, because if we are planning through IPP, we'll get rid of current manual planning sheets, right? There's no planning manual planning sheet to start with. The planning sheet of IVP will be the only source of truth. Now, if today the vendors are updating in your Excel sheet, they have access to Excel sheets. The assumption would be that will they have access to IVP Excel sheets to start with?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
I don't think so. Maybe Vignesh can. I don't think those kind of access will be provided.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, what is your question?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, so what a moment actually confirmed is that today if we if we if we tell to vendor that I need 100 pieces on a certain date vendor provides this confirmation that I will be able to provide say 80

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
out of your requested 100. No, no, no, we don't. We don't. We don't do that. So the way it works is. If I if I send a purchase order of 100 and assume that there are five line items. Let me be very clear. Assume that there are five line items.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Vignesh, I think Rahul did not complete the question. The thing is, since when we have like what he said 100 piece in the order, then those 100 piece would be coming in lot sizing or as per the manufacturing capacity, they may send it in staggered delivery. So that is not currently updated in system. Sheet so now Rahul is asking will we provide access through IBP to update directly in the system or it's going to be similar excel sheet what we want to update in the system here now because when staggered delivery because when we place an order it will be like aggregated total order quantity against one item so but then when the supplier would be based on their.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Like for example, the same example, Ashik, what you've given. Assume that you make an order for 100 quantities. And currently what we do in the SAP practice today is we say that we want to have 100 quantities, maybe June. Assume that we say June. Now the supplier, when he submits the advance ship notice, he can submit one for in the month of January for 25 February he may submit for 50 in the March he may submit for 100.

 So these sort of things are are possible. He will he will actually be able to submit partial quantities for us to receive.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
This is possible now, so that is possible, but the thing is when we provide this quantity as per the demand planning that will be an aggregated quantity which will be scheduled based on their lead time, say in 10 months and from 10 months it will be like staggered with 10 sets per month till that order is complete.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If you want, then you create it with. See, can I share my screen? No, so then you create it like this. See what you do when you create the purchase order. OK, assume that you are creating a purchase order, right?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Assume that this is the purchase order create yeah yeah vignesh understand what you are coming to the thing is we do that when there used to be prior to vmi where there used to be an ld we used to do it based on linewise segregating as per the initial stagger delivery they provide but now we don't need to do it because it's it's done from the vmi supply they based on the quantity they will and there is no

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
ld on on this deliveries it's based on the day in that case you will create one see the so assume that you'll create the PO like this Ashik okay yeah hundred quantities you want to buy 6th of 12th of June 2025 okay you want hundred quantity now what will happen is when this is going to go to the purchase to the supplier he can send January, some say for example 10 quantities, February 15 quantities.

 We are not going to break down the schedule over here. This is an aggregated quantity, 100 quantities. We are not breaking this down. If you are required to break this down, then you can, again, there is a standard way of doing this using the delivery schedules, but we don't use delivery schedules. It is a total, you know, sorry, another level down. You can use this. You can say, OK, 12, 0, 1. January, I need 10 quantities.

 And probably in the same material, in the February month, I need five quantities. This is also possible to create like this. It depends upon business.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Vignesh, I understand the vendor is also sending order acknowledgments, correct?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can we not use order acknowledgments to capture this information?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Order acknowledgment for what actually you want to capture? So in the order acknowledgment what comes from the Ariba? Yes, we. See the way it happens like this. This is how it is happening. Whenever we have a contract against that we create an order. We send it to the supplier. Now the supplier cannot do partial order acknowledgement. OK, this is not allowed from adnox side. OK, if I send him that I want 100 quantities, he must acknowledge that he will deliver.

 The 100 quantities. Now what will happen is after he does that, then there will be an advanced ship notice which will get created. You know by the supplier there he can say OK, this advanced ship notice in this ship I am I am I am actually delivering 10 quantities in this in in what it what this what this advanced ship notice means in SAP is it's an inbound delivery. OK, so if an inbound delivery it inbound delivery level you can say in this shipment I got 10 pieces in the next shipment I'm getting 15 pieces like that you can do, but order confirmation we want.

 The supplier to confirm the order in full. We do not allow partial acknowledgement of the order.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So the weakness, the only point here is that the ASN would be an action which is happening in future at the point of delivery. So whenever he's ready with 10 pieces, he'll raise an ASN and he will submit. But in planning, we need visibility on how vendor is going to deliver us, in what breakup or what staggering way he's going to deliver us. And if that visibility is available, we'll get to know that.

 Because of the staggered delivery, is it creating any problem for us from a model availability perspective?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's what I meant by order acknowledgment. It's possible.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I understand that the vendor has to confirm for the full quantity, but it's possible for the vendor to give a schedule, right?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That this XYZ quantities will be delivered on.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It should be possible that this is a standard functionality.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It is not. It is not. It should be. Is it possible or not? It is not.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so then where will he put this? See, I want a supplier to confirm the order in full. You know this. That is what this order confirmation is doing. Now after that he can break the deliveries. Now how do you? How will he propose the Schedule after the order acknowledgement. If you're going to do it essentially manually, I can go on, go to the SAP and I will keep on. Now I want the supplier to acknowledge the order in full.

 I don't want him to send me multiple order acknowledgements. So this is the This is not my decision. This is the group policy procedure. Yeah, the reason there is also reason for doing that. Because if you allow. Partial confirmations, then what will happen? Assume that I sent an order for say 100 pieces. The supplier will acknowledge for 15 pieces. Then what will I do for the rest of the quantity?

 So that is why currently we do not allow partial order acknowledgement. And this is not coming at this stage. Even during the tendering, it would have been agreed with the supplier that he will provide this. Now what you are expecting is an insight into what schedule the supplier will follow to deliver this items. Now this is something which we do not have visibility of currently. In the in the SAP system.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So so Vignesh, what are Mohammed Ashik mentioned is that the VMI vendors, the current plan manual Excel sheets planning sheets which are there. The VMI vendors have access to Excel sheets and they themselves maintain the staggered delivery in the Excel sheets.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, it is outside the system then.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, it's an Excel sheet because currently it's a manual Excel sheet, right? The planning is manual and the same Excel sheet is exposed to VMI vendors for them to update the staggered delivery. So the question remains is with IBP, would we expect the same process to follow? Would we expect them to update the IBP Excel sheet? As well with the same information is the question.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We don't have any other system provision. See what you are expecting, you know is a Is an IBP integration with Arriba's forecast collaboration module, you know, but we don't have even those sort of modules available. If you have.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
What I'm expecting is if the vendor is able to access today's Excel sheets on in ad-hoc environment. Can we allow vendor to access IBP as well? No. How will the supplier log on into the IBP?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Your first problem itself you will get into an issue because supplier will not be able to log on into the IBP solution. We'll have to give them access to IBP.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Their IDs have to be created on IBP as well.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
It will not work that we I don't know because you I I'm assuming why I'm assuming this because you know see Rahul those things are going to be very difficult so why don't we just make cut short by you know okay they will provide us a excel sheet with the delivery schedule where we have the provision to you know update the the demand planning with that based on the Staggered delivery. So whatever supplier will do, we will do it from our inventory side.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So you will send this detail to supplier and then supplier will send you back this detail and then you will update that into IBP is what you're saying?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, yes.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So does your IBP have a supplier facing portal Rahul? Hithal Nirbhashan, can you confirm?

Sergio Bastian Osorio Castro (ADNOC Group D&CS):
can create something like that, it has an app for that.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, because my understanding is that is why they had given this integration between IBP and the forecast collaboration module of Ariba, where you can provide your forecast to the Ariba forecast collaboration module and the supplier can do this staggering of deliveries there, but we don't have license for for that. I'm not, maybe you're right. I don't know whether that IBP has that sort of a feature also.



Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think there is, Vignesh, what you are saying, I heard SAP mentioning that in one of the demo sessions that there is a business network collaboration.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, that I, this part I know, Khalid, it is there. That means. But we don't have a license. We don't have a license. But my question is more towards what Rahul is trying to say. What he's trying to say is I'm going to give an access to the IBP system to the VMI suppliers so that they can come into the system and they can start staggering the deliveries. And the reason he wants to do that is he'll gain more insights into the delivery schedule.

 I don't know whether this is this is allowed even though IDP is a is an cloud system it is not hosted you know within our our service first thing is I don't know how the IDP will work IDP means

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
identity provisioning yeah because we have linked it with our yeah that will SSO yeah they need to have the ad-hoc IDP Yeah.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
OK, so then the conclusion is that this will be a manual process.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This could be a manual process or if the suppliers you know are providing this, you know you can expose an interface if they if they are going to whatever. Excel sheets from the supplier. This is what is happening today as is. Second, probably if there is an interface or an endpoint which you can provide to which the suppliers can send this data staggering data, that is another way. But again, that is all complicated things to do.

 Another one is what you said that give. An access to IDP to the suppliers, but again I think that we'll have some technical issues over there because we are using an single sign on based on our Azure IDP. 4th one is, yeah, I told you Ariba forecast collaboration, but we don't have license for that.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
OK, so then let's capture this into the comments pushbook and we will consider this as a manual process. Hector and Bastián, if there is any additional thing you can think from a supplier perspective if you think there's additional app or feature then please share more information and we can then in the next meeting validate this point again considering this additional information whether it makes sense to continue manual or use whether we can use that additional app from IBP directly.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Just let us know see it is we are not we are not closing our minds what is the app and how is that app inside the IBP itself or just let us know. We will see if it can.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
At least we will know what is possible in IBM. OK, yeah, probably then you can stop sharing from your side. Thanks so big nation will go back to the extra sheet.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, then we have the topic of time to understand What material types will be used for tie-in and how will the plan for tie-in?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
I think input is clear. Yeah, material type input is clear. It's the same drilling material type only. But the point here is how will we segregate or differentiate tying materials from drilling materials. We need some field in S4ANA which will help us differentiate between tying materials and drilling materials. So the question is, is there a way for us to differentiate between drilling material and tying material?



Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is there something in the material master?

Bastian Osorio:
Somewhere in material master which will help us identify that the specific material is related to tying and not drilling. Because at material type level both the materials are of same material type.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Same material type, yeah that's true. I think the special challenge which I see with the drilling material is we don't have much master data maintained in the system for them. Usually for the, like in MRO materials, we have a detailed material master maintained, right? And then we have a lot of attributes, even some custom material. But with the drilling, we don't have much. Abdul, do you think you have any identification for the well tie-in or not?



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, actually, so there are a list of materials available already. And the storage location... But there is no attribute in the material master which... No, material master is only the storage location.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
It could not be sufficient, yeah, because what will happen if we maintain a list somewhere, then every time new model is created, someone has to do this additional task of maintaining the list somewhere in the time. So it has to be part of an internal attribute in Metal Master. And so that whenever new model is created, it is created with that specific attribute. So the process becomes automatic and no user intervention is required because you will do it one time for at a time of Golive.

 But what happens after Golive every time a new time model is created?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, in this case, I think that the storage location they are maintaining it as for one second. What about the material group material group?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's all same.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So currently material group.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, I think like ideally ideally.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See the storage location is not the right. Uh, A storage location we require if you want to store the material, but even assume that you have even zero quantities. So how do you, even when you look at the material, like I can differentiate a wall from a gasket, from a bearing. If you have like material groups or anything which can differentiate a tie-in material, Ashik?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Vignesh, what?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
You can differentiate by material group.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, material group or story location.

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, but Ashik, some of the material common for MR also. So it will be difficult.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, that is for MR is fine, but I'm saying drilling and tile.

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Like tile also have a pressure transmitter. So something like that can be done or we will prefer to give a storage location.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
That is only for MRO, right? We now we are differentiating between drilling and

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
OK, in that case we can give them the product to PG.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Material group.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Material group would be separate for time with group we can identify tying hotel is what you're saying.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It is not there currently now like that. It's a proposal, I think.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
It is also difficult to see even though the quantity if you share with MRO and tie in. So only the the time storage only you have to consider, isn't it?

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
and see storage location.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So storage location anyway would be an attribute of a plant hierarchy, right? So if you have a material common across multiple companies using it for multiple purpose, for sure the plant attribute and storage location attribute will allow us to segregate. But even before we look at the inventory, we need to identify for a planning purpose because The extractors from S4 HANA to IBP, we need to segregate a different material based upon different planning sheets.

 We will have to have a separate planning for tying versus separate planning for drilling. We don't want to show tying materials in drilling sheet and drilling material in tying sheet. So we need to way to differentiate a material based upon any specific attribute of metal so that we can set up this differentiation from a planning perspective.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Rahul, one question here. Our planning is based on warm, right? Even in the well tie in.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
No, no, no, See, ultimately, we need to start extracting data. So the way it happens is the master data first gets extracted, right? So even for us to extract master data, we need to know for which materials we need to extract the master data. Now, material type is one parameter which will get us all the materials which are drilling and tine. Now, further between drilling and tine, we need to have some attribute which distributes the material from a drilling perspective and tine perspective, so that the respective material and the respective areas are available and extracted.

 And if we do not have any such parameter, then probably we'll need support to identify or repurpose one of the fields where we are able to identify this in Metal Master. And probably it would be a one-time activity to update the Metal Master with differentiation between time and delay so that it can be used by IBP then.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But classification any field in classification or characteristics?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We'll have to discuss that with the central cataloging team. So what I'm saying is existingly they are they are using this is my question is they can have you know see they can have they can have see it depends upon how business see the problem with the drilling items is nobody is cataloging it like the Diligently, like the MRO items. Otherwise you know the classification we can. We can, you know, differentiate it at any level we want, even not only like the drilling items we can even.

 Father, you know, break it down if we want, but nobody is doing like that for the drilling items called.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, probably this can also be applied for the material categories, right? You have OCTG item.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't know if this is captured. It can be, you know, like in a MRO item, if I can differentiate a valve from a gasket, this will also be possible. But the thing is, it is not done for the drilling items like this. Drilling items, generally, I don't know, they are not assigned to the classification characteristics, or they're not governed like the MRO items.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
For the time we are using the planning, isn't it? There will be the predefined planning as input.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
For time, I think we discussed is that the user will provide input. Manual input from user will be provided for time.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, exactly. So is it possible to take it as a like classification for the time? Whether if we captured under this plan? Let's consider the time. And the for the supply side, the quantity to be considered in particular story location only.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
To bring more supply side from a quantity, that's not a concern, but from a demand side we cannot, uh, unless I demand user input, isn't it?

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Yeah, so whether we define here with classification and all at the end we are respecting to the user plan. So if you provide the plan as per the template it the material number over there. So this would be the classification for time.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I don't think it would be a really good idea whether Hector and Bakshin you can confirm if this is something possible to differentiate metal in IVP at the time of creation of demand.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
At the time of creation of demand?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so what is what Abdul is asking is when the user uploads the demand for tine then he knows what are the materials of there as for tine. So only those materials with user updates are identified as tine. So we don't know in IBP to start with what are the tine materials and what are drilling materials and this becomes a manual input from user during the demand creation.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And not the best practice but it's possible technically. Now the point is that what you would like to have on IBP you have a view where you have filtered the time materials and then you can put the forecast or whatever for those materials. But here we don't have the way to do it, right? You are saying that let's start with the whole pool of drilling and time materials in the time view and then I decide which ones are time because I know and then IVP can put the filter but I don't think that that's the best way.

 But if it is the only way possible then Yeah, it's possible to create a filter out of that on IVP.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Vignesh, can we take this as one of the improvement opportunity because not only the segregation between drilling and tying, but then other attributes can be updated one time as an improvement opportunity for drilling materials?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We need to check with the business whether it will be possible for them to, you know, do this because I see I'm just worried that. This this way then require the team to go and look at thousands of materials classifying them and we may not have the time within our project to because I don't want to put that as a stopper for any of the processes that we are designing over here. Question here is like this.

 Rahul, assume that you are going to replicate the master data. You are going to replicate all the ZDRL materials, all your drilling materials, correct? Yeah. Now, what is going to happen for then one of the input, assume that you have the drilling bar chart, which is one of the input, and you have my SAP BOM as one of the input. So my BOM is supposed to tell you all the OCTG, liner hangers, cementing because it must be there on the bomb.

 Now when the user you're going to replicate all the drilling materials, I'm not telling you to, you know, selectively replicate material. You're just going to replicate all the drilling materials. Now assume that I am a tie in planner. OK, it's like I'm going to give an Excel sheet to you that for you know I need it. It's like a reservation. Simply, you know I'm not going to tell. For this well, I need this.

 You are. They are going to say these are the Maybe the time planner. Maybe they have their workbench like how you are creating a one for the chemicals, right? A persona. Maybe the time planner will have the tie in workbench or something like that. Let's call it planning a planning view. Maybe that's the right word planning view and whatever he is actually inputting over there that planning you because I am going as a time planner.

 I'm going and I'm inputting the requirements over there. Tie in related requirements for for the time related requirements you would have already got all the master data you know replicated from the one year because we are not selectively all drilling items I replicate or all MRO items I replicate whatever the time planner is coming and putting into his planning view that becomes you know the tie in requirements.

 I'm not telling that these are tie in materials. These are the requirements from the tie in and for that you are going to do the for the planning you are going to execute the planning, isn't it Rahul?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, so the only point which Hector was mentioning here is that ideally this is not the best practice. We would like to differentiate material so that one single filter will help us differentiate. Now what will happen is if we don't have that filter, the filter has to be applied on material level, which means we'll not filter with the weather, which is dealing metal tying metal. The time planner has to select list of all the metals which he has manually and put filters on directly.

 Do you not have a filter on planning area?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Planning area for sure it's it's a filter. So anyway, that's planning. The Excel sheet template would be unique for drilling and unique for time, but the thing is. The template will contain both the metals drilling as well as tying metals. Now someone has to tell in that planning template that X do not or consider only the So an additional filter which will allow.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think I think this is where I think this is where you know what Abdul was trying to say that some of the tie-in materials are even like MROs. You know this is what they were trying to say. It is whatever they are requiring for the time from circuit or something. He was saying you know I forgot what he was trying to say, but maybe some of the materials that the tie-in guy requires for his planning is of type.

 You know even a MRO item. So we are saying metal type is more than ZDRL is applicable for drilling and trying process. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah restrict like that.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I'm not saying I'm restricting based upon all the previous conversation. We always were told that for drilling and tying we have only one model type which is ZDRL and our direction of plan or configuration is that we will start with ZDRL and then will differentiate between drilling and tying. Now this additional input is coming for the first time in all our conversation that we are looking at additional material type as well for into drilling, into tying specifically, not drilling, which means tying is combination of ZDRL plus MRO material type.

 And now further it becomes more important for us to identify which materials are applicable for tying, because if we put only material type as filter, which means in the planning, even if we have a separate planning screen or planning sheet for the tying planner, he will see all the materials which are from ZDRL material and and metal type for MRO. Now he has to manually then unselect all the metals which are not applicable and select only the metals which he feels are relevant for time and then update demand in on the for those metals only.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is he not going to do that using Excel sheet?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
He's going to do that using Excel sheet only so. But the way the templates are defined, the templates will now have to consider drilling as well as MRO metal type right. Now there can be thousands of material which are drilling an MRO metal type because we are not further telling system that okay narrow down your filter to a next level which is first level is metal type and second level is some other fields.

 We are not telling this additional information to system. So what system will pull up the entire list of material for plant even if the sheet is different it will pull up entire list of materials.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See Rahul actually this is not how the planning will work no because assume that I'm a tie in planner. Now IDP is nearly a system where I'm just going to ask my input. OK, yes, my actual planning. Assume that I'm a time planner. I require maybe 40 different items. Now maybe outside the system I would have already done this planning and I will know that for this material I require this quantity. I will know.

 So now. What I'm going to do? I have an Excel sheet. Assume that I'm having an Excel sheet where you know this material, this quantity. Now when he's going to put that, that is basically the input to the demand when he's going to upload the demand, why he needs to unselect thousands of items. He knows exactly the material number. He knows the exact quantity. So then when he when he imports that you know that Excel sheet into the IBP, which becomes the demand, you know, then IDP is for the demand.

 It is going to do the demand planning, isn't it? For that material, why he needs to go through thousands of material? This part I did not understand quite clearly.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah, so so the point I'm trying to make is that for sure he will create. He'll provide input for his metals only, but for there is an additional step user has to follow to identify only his material. Would be on a material level, not a metal type level, which means he has to, if he has 40 metals, he first tells the system that these are the 40 metals for which I need to provide input. So that system updates the filter and only shows him those 40 materials.

 And for those 40 metals, he can update the input in the IV system so that it can get saved.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's how it will work. But this is not ideal also because, see, many people may be handling the same materials, no?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Many petal may may handle them same metal, but then the the attribute or the key figure for time would be separate and key figure for any other purpose, right? So the the time demand planner will be only updating for that model against the key figure for time. Correct. So that way, even if the model is repeating anywhere else does not matter.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Maybe I don't know.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'm not maybe able what you're trying to say, but How it looks inside the system?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so so I think then Hector Palacios. Can we agree to this that this this will be a manual process to start with and will demonstrate this into the upcoming sessions. What we have is that if we have the list of tying metals, the filter can be directly at material level.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, we can do it. Just keep in mind that the individual values that we can put is up to 200. So if we can select, that means that we can select 200 materials at a time, not more than that.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hector has a limitation of 200. Yeah. Where will we select it? Can you quickly show, Hector, is it possible for you to pull up an IBP screen and quickly show You know why I'm asking this question? See, I am assuming the process like this. Assume that I am a planner, tie-in planner. I would have done, you know, outside the system already, and I have an Excel sheet with, say, 70 items. Against that, I have the quantity, which is required for me.

 All I'm going to come there and do is, maybe you'll give me some Excel import functionality. I'll import the Excel. So then my demand, you know, comes into your... I'm not going to search for a material, but when I import the Excel, That is your demand in instead of SAP sending you by interface, the demand you got it via the Excel sheet and maybe 70 items you know will be there and that is your demand.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So where will this 200 items what you're saying will appear? Hello.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, I didn't follow completely. I don't know if, Rahul, you did follow.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So, I think, Hector, will it be possible for you to quickly pull up the sheet and show the filter? So that way then the conversation can be more clear on what we are communicating versus, yeah. Yeah, this is just a mock-up.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Don't take this seriously, but basically here you have the information of the view, right, and what you can do on the system is to go to the filter and break only the materials you want. So you can start by doing material ID. If you don't have a higher level attribute or hierarchy that you can use for this purpose, then yes, you can go material by material and save that filter indeed. The only limitation is that you can select up to 200 materials.

 So if you have more than 200 materials on tie-in that you want to bring into a view, then you need to use another attribute like, I don't know, material group, you know, or Okay, got it.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
This is where we were asking that if it is possible we do not want to go for that's not a best practice to have it at material level. It is an additional effort for someone to put up a correct filter in the sheet. They can indeed save it.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That is one of the things that even if that is not a good practice you can have the filter with all the material and save it so the next time example you can use directly and you don't need to select one by one that that is completely possible.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Now the point is that if you have like 200 materials here you need to maintain. Can I ask one question to Abdul? Abdul? Are you there Abdul?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
because others may be or Ashik. Ashik, can we define MRP controller and we can assign it to the tie-in material?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, that is possible. That is possible.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
We have also separate MRP controllers.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, because that's the organization which can probably segregate it because now what I understand what they are trying to say is If the if the tie-in planner comes, you know, and if he wants to view all this ones, he has to go and either manually choose one by one and maximum is 200. Or if I have an attribute over here, you know, called us a MRP controller. Maybe if I put the MRP controller, it may show him or show all the items.

 For that MRP controller, something like that MRP controller or whatever.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Whatever attribute we define that attribute would get level than material and then we can easily use that attribute to set up this view for him.

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
I can see MRP controller being one potential one, but I should tell you how we define this one number. I'm not the controller common item.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Mostly no, even if it is no other thing, even if it is a common item. The replenishment will be done by the tie-in because they will be having the agreements even if it is a tie-in I don't think they will be okay one more one more one more way can you click on add attribute

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
please can you click on add attribute there yeah do you have storage location as a attribute here well for now that is the location id this one no this location id is planned correct no no location id So we

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
will change the naming and we put a storage location and we add a new one called plant. But location ID is the minimum.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, OK, OK.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But in the future, this will the storage location. OK, OK, in the future this location ID will be the storage location, but we will have one more in the future called plant which will contain our plant number, correct? So the storage location is what these guys are actually So based on the storage location, you can identify the materials you're saying?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is what Bismarck is saying.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
And are we 100% sure that other than time, metals will not have the same storage locations time?

Abdul Kareem Mammy (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, that is 100% sure. In time store we have only time material.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, because then if we use storage location as one of the attribute, then all the models having that storage location.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Start coming into the planning view, right? Yes.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
And probably the stored location from MIRD will have to take up here, right?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, yeah, correct, which is MIRD, better, right? Because see in that storage location I may have tie-in materials and I may also have some MRO items like this actuator switches, something that you are saying for me. But it is a it is a plan for tie-in. It is planned for tie-in purposes. It is not planned for, you know, maintaining the plant. Those sort of switches are required for the

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So a common material will be extended to the tie-in So we'll have to filter both at plant and storage location level.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, yes, yes, exactly. So let's take this then. I think then Hector.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I think we can proceed with this right since we will be having a separate attribute for plant and storage location. Then time plant plus time storage location combination of these two attributes will help us identify the time materials.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, is there any indication? And the storage location like a description that is saying that this is for tie-in or an additional attribute that we can use to basically group all the storage locations are for tie-in or we will need to watch storage location

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
by storage location? Just one minute, Sachin. It's easy because they have a normal, usually they have a 3001L and I'll put 1200. They have a common naming convention. This is like S0, S091. I think this is something that they are using. Let me just check one minute.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, why are you checking? How frequently we add storage locations?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Not that frequently, especially in the especially not for these onshore offshore companies and all.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So is it safe to assume that the definition of storage location is a kind of firm and we don't expect it to change very frequently or at least it will not be very frequently, yes. But then from a from a from an action perspective, master data perspective, whenever new storage location for tying is created, then someone has to update the planning sheet with the new storage location so that it gets But the thing

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
is you know that item can be available in other soil location as well it's not only tie-in soil location.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah but we are saying tie-in soil location is the way to identify the materials not the inventory.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah okay for identification of tie-in material yeah that could be See, Ashik, I do, you know, I guess I cannot, I don't know whether Abdul is there, but I pasted a screenshot on the chat. If anybody is sharing, you can show it for onshore. That is how, you know, the tie-in stores, they have, you know, tie-in, NEB, Buhasa, these are the type of, you know, that is there. But for offshore, I don't see...

 No, we don't have tie-in for offshore, it's only for onshore. So then how will they connect their well to the mainland?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
That is not through this planning, it is through some service, some projects. They don't save material for these projects. So, tie-in only for onshore, right? Yes, yes.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then you are clear.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so then we'll use the storage location, but then can we put up a filter based upon this description attribute? Can we put up a logic with respect to this, so that if anytime in future, if the new storage location is created and if it is following the same nomenclature, then no one has to add it manually and if it follows this nomenclature, it becomes part of the IBP extraction?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think yes and if even if somebody if somebody missed the nomenclature then it will have to be manually added.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
But I think to identify even it's the same thing even if you are adding MRP controller or store location it's going to be the same thing Abdukarim. Don't you think? Because if it is part of the forecast you will anyway identify him as the MRP controller.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The only problem is our shake. In that case, what you see that the downside of that is assume that you have an MRO item. Maybe in that MRO item. If it is, if what if it is an MRO item and and it is assigned to an MRO. Is that a possibility?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Then it will not come under the tie in MRP controller. It is possible, but that will be MRP area driven refreshment. You can identify, I think this will be better option I think storage location you can go ahead with this.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So quick question Hector, will this be set up in CIDS at a time of extraction or will this be set up manually into the planning screen in Excel add-in?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Which part you're saying Rahul, the description?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
The storage location, the identification of storage location. If you see my screen, these are the storage locations which are applicable. So the definition of plant and storage location. So, plant would be input for us. We know how many plants are there, right? So, we know plants and additional within the plant, any storage location with description tying into it would be applicable for tying. Now, this definition of tying materials to identify tying materials, will you make it part of the CIDS extraction?



Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, it's totally possible.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So if we make it part of CID extraction, then by default we will have the segregation between the time materials and any other material, and only those materials show up in the time planning sheet, correct?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah. Can I ask? Can I ask you one thing? Is it? Is it possible from your side, Rahul? Is it possible when you're creating a planning sheet, right? Planning planning workbench or planning You make a configuration and you say that these are the storage locations for, you know, I in planning. Now that's something you know, like a configuration or something like that. Now you through the interface would have replicated Marty table.

 OK, so when somebody comes into the planning workbench or the planning sheet, your material master would have come through the interface. Plus also the configuration for the you would have maintained these are the storage locations. So basically the only the items belonging to that storage location and that plan combination will be shown in that planning area. Is it not like that? It's what we're talking about.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
The only difference what we're talking about is the definition of storage location. Do you want to do it in the Excel sheet or do you want to make it that difference? Also part of the CIDS interface only. So when the data is getting extracted at the point of extract only will that this data is identified as time.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think so if it can be as as configuration, leave it as configuration.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
OK, so you prefer this storage location definition to be part of the Excel sheet. Manual definition as part of public configuration is what we call configuration because configuration what we're seeing at configuration is the basically setting up the correct filters.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, basically you can set up the default filters right for the for the planning area. In that area you as an administrator will set that these are the default filters. This 355 locations which we are seeing the reason why is doing too much of this process on the CIDS level and for what really. I don't know because tomorrow if there is a change or something, then again see interface level changes are required.

 Configure it like this way, and if there is an interface, you know, CIDS automation thing when we will see that later on.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK noted.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So first of all, let's take this as input.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And you know this is also the reason why I'm telling you is this is not thousands of storage locations. Yeah, it is only. Quite few so. Less than 10. I don't want to do a big for that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, noted.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
So to summarize, tying materials would be identified in combination with plant and storage location. The description of the storage location will be tying and this is what will be used. The definition of the storage location would be as part of the filter setup. Filter will set up for planning sheet so that eventually if new storage location has to be added then it is easier for for an administrator to add update that filter with the correct storage locations.

 The default filter. OK. OK. Hector bastion and could be aligned on this time identification of time material. Yeah, yeah, yes. OK, uh, going back to your seat.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Do you have any other point?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
We've already 10 minutes beyond our planned meeting time, so do you have any other Are we good here?

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Oh yeah, we just had the last point about what level the time materials that we planned at. We said I think material and plant level. If if there are more questions on this, then we can discuss otherwise.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
This is this is we've discussed, but I just want to make sure we are confirming this in the time session. Also, we are discussed that the tying metals are not related to the planning tying material is not related to a well, which means the planning will happen at a combination of material and plant level as to its location right now what we've discussed. So there is no additional attribute which aligns this plant to a well.



Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is this confirmed? Yes, it's not there in the system, yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, okay.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
We just wanted to make sure we are aligned there, which means the tying material will be like any other material. Only the muttered type is drilling plus some few MRO metal, but then the planning levels is material plant and storage location combination.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes. OK, noted.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
I think this was the last question we had. Let's conclude this session and Abdul and Mohammed Ashiq and Abdul. Maybe we'll connect again. Not maybe, we'll for sure connect again. On Thursday for the discussion. If you have any other question in the meantime, please ping me, please call me so that if there are any other clarifications required while preparing the data, I'll be glad to help you out, guys.



Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I have some very quick questions for Vignesh, Rafa. So, Vivek was asking on our side if he can run some tests for the MRP run on S4 HANA. He just wants to understand better the real the point based planning. It is possible to do that. Who wants to know? Vivek is one of the consultants for the supply part.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, what he wants to know.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, I did not understand. He wants to know if he can run some tests on MRP run on S4HANA.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See, in the sandbox, right Hector? Yeah, the access that we have to make. Please ask him to run using MD03, OK? Because let him see it's OK for him to execute the MRP for materials. Just don't ask him to run the MRP at the entire plant because then it will. It will plan for all the items in the plant. OK, can you repeat the what?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you repeat the filter again?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The easier way? Let me let me share my screen. Are you able to see my screen?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
MD03 or MD01, MRP are you guys using today? No, no, don't use MD01N. We are not using MD01N. If you want to use MD03, this is the transaction. What you will be able to do using MD03 is you can give the material, you can give the plant, and then you can run this MRP. For each and every material, if you want to check you can run this one, but I'm just telling you don't run MD 01 because this is not material relevant.

 It will try to plan for all the materials in the plant, which will take a very long time. You know it is not that something wrong, but it will take a long instead of that. He can choose a material or he can even create a material if he wants and or copy a material. Choose a material. We put the material code over here, put the plant over here and run this, there is no issue.

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, can you write please? Just to avoid any confusion, can you write it on the chat?

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The name of the transaction? MD03, MD03. I put it on the chat.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Right, perfect, got it. Hector, additionally, if you need any help on S4 side, you can connect with me and Kushboo as well for running this transaction. Also, Vignesh has shared a few example of reorder point from

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I've already shared.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, so you can refer to that example as well when you're running the MRP so that you know the scenarios of different scenarios of reorder point planning which we've never shared with us from AdBlock. And if you have any questions, yeah, we can connect and then take it with Ignis.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Yeah, I have one question on the yeah, probably just just a second. We have a regarding the unit of measure. I mean, how is that? How are you doing the conversion? Because we may have different unit of measure in PO. The forecasting and and so base unit of measure. So how is the conversion in the plan? The demand? I mean the supply planning will be done at the forecast level unit of measure.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Hector, you want to answer that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, I didn't catch up. I was writing to you.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 1:
Yeah, the question is, they have multiple units of measurements for each material. So you have one base unit of measurement, and then there are multiple different units of measurements. So how IBP will be able to use different multiple units of measurements at demand level versus at supply level?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Demand?

Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I mean, we have the conversion. I don't know what is the difference between demand and supply, but if you have all the you need to measure that you need to use on the system on S4HANA today, then we are going to integrate from the standard

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
table. So we will use exactly the same conversions you have seen. The way this works on the standard is at the material master level, you can have materials and you can have unit of measure and alternate unit of measure with conversion factors at the material level. In addition to that, there is an object called as info record. So in the info record, info record is material plus vendor combination.

 If you have some specific thing at the info record, that can be considered. But I don't think they are diligently maintaining the info record like that. What they do is, whenever the purchase order is created, they are putting auto info update. Basically, the info record gets updated. So that's where you have For this vendor, what is the conversion between base unit of measure maybe to the order unit of measure will be there?



Hector Palacios (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That is one of the point we want to understand indeed. When we raise the PR, what is the unit of measure of that? If we need to have a specific one by vendor, then that would be great to have that information. The current state of IDP, the standard is the conversion is by material only. It can be configured, customized to go to the vendor material level if we need it for that purpose.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Additionally, Vignesh, a question here. You also have the purchasing unit or ordering unit of measurement in procurement view of material master, correct? So if we have one- They don't do it.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See, their field is there, Rahul, but that is not maintained in many to 95% of the cases they don't maintain this.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
OK, so which means you're saying the most reliable information considering this automatically updated from PO is the info record.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, that is the info record has this information.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
But there is one issue here because in the forecast the demand supply plane planning would should be done at the at the supplied by the by the end user because currently that has been done as the practice because you might have a different unit measure maintain say for example a line pipe okay maybe it is it could be a meter or it could be it could be in feet but in the supply plan we use one unit of measure for every item.



Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So just to make sure I'm understanding So, you have demand and the demand, let's take this example of pipe, right? So, pipe can have one unit of measurement as length in terms of meter. Another unit of measurement can be pieces, like if you have six meter pipe, then you have piece as one unit of measurement and then one piece is equal to six meter. I'm just putting, coming up with an example, right?

 Now, when you capture the demand, will you capture demand in this base unit of measurement, which is better? Or you will capture demand in pieces?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So it would be for all the line pipe in the supply chain will be, I mean, supply demand will be one unit of measure.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So maybe it could be meter. Yeah, OK. So that same item can have.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So the same item can be in feet or some other pieces in the base unit. So what you are saying is if the demand is in say meters, then the same unit of measurement is used for supply planning as well?

Bastian Osorio:
Is it necessary?

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
No, maybe all the line type could be in meter in supply demand, but in base unit it can be different.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So there are multiple ways to do this. One is when we are creating demand. So demand for drilling material is based upon the bill of material. So when you're creating the bill of material, you can choose what is the unit of measurement which you want to use in the bill of material. It can be base unit of measurement, or it can be any of the alternate unit of measurement for the material. So when defining the BOM, the unit of measurement is part of the bill of material.

 And whatever bill of material unit of measurement we define, that can become the demand bill of material, demand unit of measurement.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, that is fine for the drilling.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
What about tie-in? It's an user input, right? So user is providing this input. So user provides the input of the material. Because in IPP, you will have all the units of measurement for the material, the base unit as well as alternative measurement. So user will provide the input in the unit of measurement is calculating the demand.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
So then it will calculate all whatever the unit of measurement provided by the end user.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
Yeah. Basically, let's take an example of pipe. A pipe is meter as well as feet. You have both in it, right? But the base unit is meter, and the alternate unit is feet, right? Now, if user says that I want to enter demand in feet, that I need, say, 200 feet pipe, then the conversion factor is set up in IBP. It is extracted from S4 HANA directly, which means IBP knows that 200 feet is equivalent to, say, 50 meters.

 I'm just coming up with an example. Conversion but if that's the conversion maintained then it will always convert automatically at the back end.

Mohammed Ashic (ADNOC Onshore - PD):
Okay we'll see it on the maybe when we are in the final stages here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah we can see this as part of the demonstration. All right.

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
So anyone has any other question?

Conference Room (Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS)) - Speaker 2:
OK, then if there are no further questions, then thank you very much for joining, Mohammad Ashiq, Abdul, and Abdul, everyone. Let's continue the discussion as we planned for Thursday.

Abdul Lathief Muhammed Kunhi (ADNOC Offshore - IC):
Thank you. Bye-bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.

Khushboo Mudit (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.
