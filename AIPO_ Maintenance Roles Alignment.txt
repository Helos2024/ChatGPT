So the stock replenishment process, and Vignesh and Khalid correct me if I'm wrong, currently as is, we have when a new project is created or let's say constructed and operated the SPIR process is managed by the cataloging team together with the project in order to review and purchase at the end the two years operating space or whatever, operating spares, we need mostly spare parts. And those are then migrated to the system, one ERP at the moment, and then with a complete setup.\n\n And then based on the movement, issue, return, reservation, count adjustment, et cetera, the monthly replenishment process is triggered and then the inventory controllers assigned to various groups, they procure whatever stock quantities required based on the requirement and the setup in the system. This process before I was involved. Now, Vignesh, is there any change after we did the shared services of what I said?\n\n"},{"start_time":1732271682003,"end_time":1732271684571,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"No, sir.

Now, during the operation of the plant, there could be additional stock requirement, maybe change in the setup, maybe new items, new materials to be stocked. So, there's something we call it proposal for stock. What is it called now, Vignesh, the proposal MDG?"},{"start_time":1732271707589,"end_time":1732271713911,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Yeah, it is MDG, material cataloging.

So a proposal for the stock is created specifying the requirement with respect to the item specification, setup, consumption, et cetera, et cetera, price, manufacturer, single or whatever. And then the inventory controller After approval, he will buy this item and stock it accordingly. And then based on the operation requirement, for instance, we have for maintenance, mainly we have the work order.\n\n A work order is created by the planner based on the maintenance request, whether it is planned or unplanned or corrective or predictive or preventive, whatever, or shutdown. The planners, they create the work order, they assign the operations and the stock item requirement, or the component they call that, and also the direct material requirement. And if it is a shutdown related and long lead item, normally they do that.\n\n If it is complex shutdown, they do it maybe one and a half years in advance so that the inventory controller, in case they are required more than what we have in stock, they plan accordingly. If the item is not planned in advance, maybe they just have a breakdown and it was not anticipated. If the item is critical, normally it is available in stock, maybe never used, but it is critical. We call it almost like insurance item.\n\n So the insurance with respect to the plant operation. So if this pump is broken or compressor, we ensure that those critical items are available always in stock. At least one piece, it depends on the usage and also the population of number of equipment. But mostly it is zero, one setup, you know, one piece in stock. And we raise the work order as a maintenance to fix the pump immediately. And we take the item directly from the store.\n\n The inventory controller during the monthly replenishment, they go and buy this item again. But in case we have a double breakdown, we are in trouble, of course, which is a rare case, but it can happen. Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide the second item from inventory unless we have an agreement, long-term agreement with this item is specified and we agree lead time and the item maybe is air freighted from Europe or US or whatever, straight to AdMob.\n\n So the involvement, what I'm trying to say here, the as-is process, if we go to the companies and tell them, look, this is what now you need to do, he will tell you why I have to do this now. I mean, what we were doing before. So it's good to document the as-is process, what we are doing now in AdNoc for inventory controller, by inventory controller, and What are we planning to do in the 2B? And what is the change?\n\n Why this change is required? What is the business benefit value? And what is the impact on the organization in case we have a change in the roles or change in the process? What would be the impact on the organization? Does it make sense? Gentlemen, what I said. Yes, yes, yes, yes."},{"start_time":1732271956829,"end_time":1732272031619,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"See what we want to do here is see what we want to do here is.

Also, we will try to explain to you what IBP is going to do in the future and why there is an involvement by the maintenance team now in the new solution, whereas there was no maintenance team involvement during the previous stage.\n\n We will try to explain this. Now, what we want from your side is in order to take this up with the maintenance team because I think they are not very receptive to the idea and it becomes an issue when we start discussing it.

And they cannot, they don't know what is as is and why you are asking this. So for them, it is something maybe a new so why now you need this from me I was never involved before and and maybe they will not be involved that maybe only the the planners on site will be involved but nobody was there from the planners so we need to know who are the right audiences from the companies to ensure that we have at least one or two SMEs they do the maintenance plan they do the reservation of the stock material, they fully know and experience with the inventory management process and then they will, you will tell them what is to be and why we are doing it and if there is improvement in the supply of materials and less headache for them of stock out and break down, sorry, because the material is not available and no air freight cost.\n\n This prove to them that yes, we will will improve this operations.

I suggest we involve downstream first, because they are heavily maintenance with many rotating equipment, much more than upstream and other companies.\n\n Or maybe Adnogas, Sour gas. Adnogas is the biggest, you can say in terms of MRO, spare parts and spare part management and stock replenishment and all that.

What is happening today? Whenever now see the entire topic for today is about corrective maintenance. We are not talking about any other preventive maintenance. We are not talking about those cases. Our topic of today is corrective maintenance. Now whenever there is a corrective maintenance that is required on equipment, you create a work order. This is what the EWM team does, and a reservation is created in the SAP system.\n\n Now today, as far as you are concerned, after the work order, in the work order you are putting the components and you are saying that in order to do my corrective I need this components this many quantities and after that there is an There is an approval process, correct? There is an approval process and once the approval process is done, then the end users that is the maintenance team there. Their job is currently then their job is done.\n\n Now the system what it does is now the system it takes the reservation and it for each and every material. You know the required quantity that is whatever quantity you require versus the reorder point and my on hand stock just for simplicity. It will compare this. Now your job for maintenance. Your job was completed. You are no longer involved in the picture, but what is happening now is the MRP engine today in the SAP HANA.\n\n And that's this it come. It compares your reservation quantity with your require. Your requirement quantity with the reorder points plus your on hand stock. And you know, purchase orders which are open. So these sort of things it will. It will compare and what it will do. It will. It will check them for our reorder point planning. It will check if I have to replenish this item. If it falls below the reorder point, it will try to order till the reorder point.\n\n So this is currently happening in the one ERP and Nobody really gets into this process. This is a this. I will call this as a Tactical, you know, planning there is. I will tell you why I'm calling this tactical later on, but this is, you know, whenever in short, whenever the material you know required falls below the reorder point, the MRP engine is going to replenish to the reorder point or the maximum stock.\n\n Whatever it is there now, your EWM team is never involved in this process. Process and the inventory controller team. Once the PR is created, they go and review the quantity and then they, you know, proceed with ordering the quantity. This is what is happening today. So the key point here is the MRP engine. Compares their requirement and if it falls below the reorder point alone, it will start, you know, replenishing the Quantities now this is now the in the future in the to be Now what is going to happen?\n\n The the scenario is going to change a little bit. So now what they are going to do is they are not going to operate in this manner. Now what they are trying to say is the IBP tool is more of a strategic planning tool and not a tactical planning tool. What what what that means now in order for me to to replenish or make the materials available to you. I am not going to really check."},{"start_time":1732272630427,"end_time":1732272635219,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Let us use stock stock material always because stock stock items only."},{"start_time":1732272635219,"end_time":1732272692538,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Today we are only talking about stock items.

Now what they are doing in this tool, in the new IDP tool, they are trying to do something as a strategic planning.\n\n So what they are going to do for a material, they are going to take all the previous consumption, OK?

There are slow moving items which can be moved once in five years. There are some some fast moving items which may move once in a year or twice in a year, and there could be some medium moving items which may move once in three years. But whatever the movement is. The concept what IDP is saying is I will look at your historical consumption and it will apply their AI or ML algorithms.\n\n This is where their sophisticated planning model is going to come and it will propose to you. Previously, you've seen that currently it never proposes. Simply if the stock falls below the reorder point, This is what currently it's happening, but what this strategic model is trying to do. It is going to. Take your previous consumption and it is going to, you know, run and say machine learning model or whatever as advanced planning models and then it is going to tell the maintenance user.\n\n See based on your previous consumption, this will be your requirement in the next few periods. Now what they are expecting the maintenance planner to do is they are expecting the maintenance planner to review this information, which the system is going to system is going to propose. It's not that you know he has to start from the system is going to propose based on your previous consumption. This is my proposal.\n\n The part that they want the maintenance planner to do over here is review that information. And they want him to say, OK, I agree. Assume that for the next six months it is. It's proposing four four piece pieces are that is what we based on the previous consumption. It has said for the next six months you need four pieces. You know in each month now what they are requesting. You know the maintenance planner to do is probably review this information and he'll say maybe the maintenance planner may have you know additional information and he may say OK in this month I don't need four pieces.\n\n If I have two pieces, maybe in this another month, you know I may need five pieces. So this correction, you know this is what they are calling as the demand system will take the consumption, do the forecast and it places the forecast or the demand for review by the Maintenance planner once the maintenance planner completes that, that's it. His involvement is there done and that demand becomes an input for inventory controller to start his planning.\n\n So now this is where they want maintenance team maintenance teams involvement.

I think that we haven't closed this. For sure this is going to depend a lot on the classification of the fast moving, medium moving, slow moving. We are not expecting to update this on a frequently basis if this is a slow mover that is become some like every three years, you know. So it's going to depend on that.

Now the subject is becoming more clear when what Hector is mentioning that the IBP will be mainly for the fast moving item with respect to replenishment. And that makes sense because normally it is done now using the MRP, right, Vignesh? Yes, yes, yes, yes. But the stock items that are medium and slow mover, normally the replenishment is done based on the movement and mainly reservation. Especially, you said this process covers corrective maintenance, but for me, there is, let's say, Connective maintenance also cover shutdowns, but shutdowns, there are some ad hoc shutdown and there are some planned shutdown.\n\n Now, ad hoc shutdown, I cannot do anything. I have to have most of the materials available in stock if I need to do this ad hoc shutdown. If I have a long-term shutdown and I know some stock items, they are only one piece in stock, maybe I need two or three because I'm taking more machines, at the same time taking opportunity of the downtime. No consumption history will be able to give you this forecast, but the reservation process, we used to call it before system Maximo, before even any system, we used to call it shutdown shopping list.\n\n This shutdown shopping list, it was a very critical process, which we call it now work order reservation. It is created at least one year in advance so that I ensure that all the stock materials and the direct materials are all available ahead of the shutdown in order to give the green light to start the shutdown."},{"start_time":1732273204295,"end_time":1732273204792,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Clear?"},{"start_time":1732273204792,"end_time":1732273207774,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay.

Sorry, yes, that is completely clear for us. We also need to consider not only the corrective part, but also the requirements are coming from the turnaround and the preventive plans.

Yes. Just clarify with me something to me, Vignesh, about the preventive maintenance plan, because the preventive maintenance. It is similar to corrective maintenance. I create a work order from a plan and this work order I go and open the machine and then I have some consumable which I already have in stock because I know these will be used and I put them already in the reservation.\n\n However, when I open the machine, I find that there are more materials are required, so I create to we call it a structured corrective follow-up work order from preventive maintenance or from predictive maintenance. And then I request additional material which I need to have them available in stock in order to do the repair of the machine or the placement of the part that we found it is need to be replaced before a breakdown happens.\n\n So this is a proactive maintenance based on preventive time-based or predictive based on vibration, other.

So first of all, the planning horizon is three to five years, okay? So we look to have a long-term visibility here. And as I said, we have four steps, demand planning, inventory planning, supply planning, and finally, financial planning, okay? So first of all, demand planning, what is the main output and agreed material forecast?\n\n We will need for the next three to five years. And at which level is this going to happen? It is going to happen on a monthly basis and on a material and location, at a material and location level."},{"start_time":1732273396710,"end_time":1732273402979,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Okay.

That's right, but this is on a very high level. Of course, for soil materials it is very likely that you will need to check on a, I don't know, as you said, yearly basis.

So let me clarify one actually what is they are going to do is which I think they did not make, they are going to segment the materials. So, material segmentation there is a and they are in the segmentation they are mentioning. So, according to this segmentation they are going to classify the materials and then they will see which material needs to be planned annually, quarterly or weekly maybe.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732273465186,"end_time":1732273477206,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"And please, place the word material always with stop.

So then the second step is the inventory is inventory phase. Here the main output. The only output is the inventory policy. Will be safety stock and other cases will be reorder point. Again, for which cases we're going to use safety stock and for which cases we're going to use reorder point, as Kunal mentioned, is going to be dependent of the segmentation. Consumption, demand pattern, we will take a look at that in a moment.\n\n So here this has, in some cases, it will have a monthly update but I think in most cases we will have a quarterly update and even yearly update. And again this is happening at stock material level and location. And then we go to the next part which is the supply part and here the output is to get first a procurement plan how much we need to buy for the next three to but also a distribution plan, meaning that if, for example, we have overstock in some location and in other location we have understock, we have a low value of the stock, the system will recommend to move stock from one plant or one location to another.\n\n So it avoids incurring additional expenses that are unnecessary. Again, this is going to be be happening on a monthly basis. And finally, we can finalize this with a financial view. What is this? How much our plan is going to cost for the next three to five years? We can compare this with a budget. And of course, it also can happen in a material location level. Although, of course, the financial people in general, when you want to look at financial figures, you don't look at this level.\n\n Look at a location, at a plant level, or even an AGC level. And the review, the update can be in a quarterly or on a yearly basis. So first, this is very, here we're talking a very, very aggregated level. As I said, we need to, each different material, each different business area will have its own specifics, right? But at least on a high level, we are looking to consolidate our overall plan for the entire company.\n\n So this is how it starts looking like, And here we can see more details. So we will have for the entire process, we'll have two components. We will have corrective, preventive, this is for MRO or for stock parts, let's call it that way, projects, which is dream, drilling wells and chemicals. In EPC we can, I think it's out of the scope."},{"start_time":1732273669691,"end_time":1732273671539,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yes, got it."},{"start_time":1732273671539,"end_time":1732273786088,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"OK. So for corrective, as I said, we're going to start with integrating, of course, from S4HANA to IVP, all the stock materials with its historical consumption. The more information we have, the better. We're going to integrate also hierarchies, so users can have more information to aggregate or disaggregate, so you can have a more insightful analysis. And with that, we're going to run a segmentation and also a statistical forecast.\n\n After the statistical forecast, there is a stage called So, in some cases, if the user wants to change the forecast because of some expert knowledge, they can do that. At the end, the final word is always the planner's word. So, as you can see, we have the maintenance plan for this part. Then, the next part of the process, of course, we're going to focus on this part in demand planning, but just in a nutshell, then with that input is that the inventory planning can run the inventory operator and generate the inventory policy.\n\n And then we combine these two inputs to generate the supply plan. So as you can see here, we also have the preventive component, which is composed by maintenance activities. Of course, the maintenance activities have bumps, and the bumps will generate consumption. So we will also forecast for the stock materials needed to perform these activities. And this will also be a component of the final supply plan.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732273786088,"end_time":1732273853040,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Okay. Let me ask a question, Bastian. Yeah, of course. In the corrective maintenance, you are using the work order historical consumption, correct? Yeah. Okay. Preventive maintenance, we also have historical consumption. So why not also doing the same, bearing in mind that the preventive maintenance plans that we have at the moment may not cover all the materials required, either by mistake or because we discovered that additional materials are required during the preventive maintenance.\n\n And the maintenance engineer, he does not raise, unfortunately, the right work order type, which is correct. He consumes the material under preventive. So you will find that the consumption of preventive maintenance on the work order may be more accurate than the plan."},{"start_time":1732273853040,"end_time":1732273939743,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"So that's my question. Input, and we have heard that before. So, of course, this is the best practice, let's say. In an ideal world, you will have your, as you said, your preventive plan with all the bombs correctly completed, right? But we know that is not the case. And it will never be, because for the last 40 years, it's never there. 40 years. So there is a workaround where we also integrate the preventive consumption and we can so we have two ways to do it here we can run a statistical forecast or we can just simply replicate it to the future like we copied last year to the next year and so on so forth so of course we will find what is the right way to go once we have the data and we can test basically we will show the different options and we can see which one is more accurate Maybe in some cases, I don't know, I'm just supposing here, in some cases you will have preventive plan, in some of the cases you have none, and then you will have to run a statistical forecast.\n\n And in some other cases, maybe the historical consumption is very accurate, it's very good, so you can just replicate it to the future. We don't know, but we have these multiple options that will need to be tested during the test phase and see what is it."},{"start_time":1732273939846,"end_time":1732273979311,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"At the end there is also a work order type called general for maintenance and general for non-maintenance.

Yeah, go ahead please. So yeah, before jumping into the segmentation part I want to highlight as we saw here and we're also doing here that we're like we have two let's say two perspectives here the one is that this system and we have here a layer of this other visibility I lost you for one second can you repeat again please yeah so I'm saying that we have two perspectives here okay we're trying to address two perspectives the first one is more tactical and strategic three to five years and not not just for for stock parts but also for dream and for chemicals yes okay so that's one thing but then the second perspective the second let's say usability is more is approaching the more uh operational side where we have it here right where we have a a supply plan procurement and distribution so it's basically it's like I have a uh well control tower I don't know how to you because this can lead to misunderstanding but I have a control and of course the system have plenty of dashboards and alerts that can be used to track anything weird happening, okay?\n\n Okay, so this is the segmentation that is going to be key for the project because it's going to be useful not just for for demand planning but also for inventory planning. So what is the, it has, it will have multiple use. We are leveraging what you already have. Here we are using this, which is what we are proposing the best practice, which is also what you're using. So here not, we are not inventing the wheel.\n\n Okay. So first, what is the purpose of the segmentation planning is, first of all, identify where the users can add more value. For some items, for some stock materials, the users, the system will do very good by itself, okay? So in that case, the users don't need to put too much attention. But for other materials, let's say they have very intermittent, very erratic, very, yeah, very erratic demand, the system won't do a very good job forecasting.\n\n So in those cases, when these materials are critical, we need time from the planners to be allocated here. So the system will help us to determine in which material the users can add more value. And how we do that? Through a segmentation. So first of all, we have a ABC segmentation that basically follows the Pareto law and divide the materials by consumption value. Then we have the FMSN. You probably know this better than us.\n\n Which is based on stocking holding value again following the Pareto law. Based on unit price then BED. And we also propose a lead time cementation that can also add value. And here we put where it can be useful, in which part of the process. So as you mentioned, for certain materials, for some of the medium and slow movers, we're not going to use the forecast because we're only going to use reorder point.\n\n So in that case, you don't need to focus on them. You better focus on the fast movers, right? For the forecast. So that's one thing. And then even if you have fast movers, well, of course, first go for the vital ones. If there are and so on support. So in this way, it is way more easier, more straightforward the work of the planners."},{"start_time":1732274283201,"end_time":1732274283608,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Okay."},{"start_time":1732274283608,"end_time":1732274296227,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"I think having said that, I think we can jump into the system.

So this is going to be, of course, a brief demo because we don't have that much time. But just so you know, we have two main interfaces. The first one is this that looks like Excel, but is, in fact, we are connected to the cloud. On cloud solution that have two interfaces. One is the Fiori app and that where you can have dashboards, analytics, others, so on and so forth. And this one is Excel.\n\n Why? It's like the cloud connected to Excel. So SAP thought that or realized that most users, most planners work in Excel. So instead of creating everything in Fiori created this Excel add-in so users can basically use Excel to plan, which has been always the case. In a nutshell, we have here template admin where you have the different templates. When we say template, we mean that every step of this process will have a planning view.\n\n So here, Demo Planning, Inventory Planning, of course, the facility is not fully configured yet, so we don't have all the templates, but once we go live and we start testing, we will start populating the system with different views, right? So users, okay, let's go to Supply Planning. They can go here and access to that planning view and adjust it based on their needs, okay? How they can adjust it?\n\n They go here to edit planning view. Okay.

But we also will have the AGC for example, which will be a hierarchy for multiple plants. Okay. Then we have the BED, then we the demand pattern, which is going to play a key role. I will explain in a second. And then we have the material or stock material, as you said. And then we have the key figures, which is the information, the data that we will see at this level.\n\n So for now, I will show you a very simplistic example, just to understand the point. To understand the point of the system and then of course you can escalate it to instead of looking at individual stock materials go to, I don't know, see the entire demand for AGC even. So first here we have the actual usage of materials for corrective maintenance over the last basically four years, right? Then we have the reservations.\n\n Here are the historical reservations. So you right away can start seeing that we have some differences. The actual consumption is different than the material reservation. And then using the actual usage, the system will generate the statistical forecast. So let's go here. So here we have the... And it's essential. And the demand pattern is intermittent. Intermittent means that it can be modeled by two variables.\n\n The frequency of consumption, let's say every one year or every six months, and then a quantity, okay? Let's say on average, Of course, on average, the material is consumed every six months. And every time it is consumed, it consumes five units, just an example. So the system, when understand, well, using material learning, when the system identifies that it is intermittent, apply the right model.\n\n It doesn't apply, let's say, a seasonality model or a trend model. Why? Because identify that the model, that the historical pattern is intermittent. Okay? So using this segmentation, the statistical forecast works. Okay? Okay. But then on the top of that, we have the forecast for CM. Okay? So if the planner thinks based on his expert knowledge, no, four is too much or it's too he can change it. He can leave a comment, and we will keep track on all the changes.\n\n And then we have the final forecast, which is, of course, when there is no input from the planner, the system will take the statistical forecast by default. And if there is an input from the planner, well, we take that. So two things here. Once the collaboration is finished, we run as a snapshot. We take a photo of the collaboration and the statistical forecast. So in this way, and after a few months of using the system, for each stock material and at the different locations, we will be able to track the accuracy.\n\n So we will be able to say, look, for these materials, I don't know, during the last two years, the system has been way more accurate. So you better don't put any input there because doing better than the planners but it will be also in some cases the reverse case where the planners make a way better job than the system so they you you better focus there right but this this of course this value added it will happen after some some months of of the of the users and and not using idp okay the system also knows the stock category for instance is it"},{"start_time":1732274747561,"end_time":1732274762670,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"obsolete is it redundant so will take also action accordingly and only will how he will force how the obsolescence is managed by the system is there any intelligence is that as well?"},{"start_time":1732274762670,"end_time":1732274773714,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"The obsolescence of stock or you mean of the material you don't need you don't use this that material anymore There are both cases."},{"start_time":1732274773714,"end_time":1732274786501,"speaker":{"name":"Nabil Ghalib (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Either I remove the equipment or the material becomes obsolete.

And now I'm thinking loud. If I have a mechanical planner, electrical planner, instrument planner, all of them will be involved. How much is the frequency this will be done? How many items are we talking about? As Mohamad said, there's a big impact. We need to assess what is the impact, and what is the scope, what is the number of item?\n\n Is it monthly? Is it weekly? Quarterly, it make big difference. I mean, if you tell me annually, okay, I can swallow it, you know, once a year, we can do this plan, because we are preparing budget anyway. And this will improve our budgeting process. So this I have a benefit that if I do annual plan, I know that this is what I will consume in 2025. So this will be great for my budget accuracy, right?\n\n But if you tell me, do that once a year, that's fine. If you tell do it every month that they will we need to have an organization change right yeah so that is where we need your help to like identify how to take this up now I need if you need my help you need really to have an excellent simple presentation with the help of the inventory team what we're doing now and what we want to do in the future and why and how we will implement it okay and what is the prerequisite especially data cleansing and all that you cannot leave us alone thinking about that I am also alone working in thousands of job so if you talk to me tomorrow I will tell you oh what I told you yesterday I forgot it's good that you recorded it like you corrected me right now Rahul so really we need also from your side I don't know if you have a maintenance engineer part of the project that he will or maintenance SME that he will also help in this change, you know, impact assessment and rollout for successful implementation.\n\n Maybe, for instance, I give you example in a recent implementation of Meridian GE. We did not only do training, we did regular training and awareness sessions and During GoLive, we did one month of on-the-job training, one month we did, okay, which we segregated over a few, more than one month, in fact, at the end, in order to give more support to the end user and help them implement this successfully.\n\n If you, as a consultant, just complete that and rely only on AdNoc and give just training and give this system Without support after GoLive, it will not work.

Now, even before GoLive, as we go back to mentioned we're wrapping up design now but next will be a couple of months of configuration where we will involve everyone so it becomes more of an interactive configuration they'll see the solution they'll also check based on what there is a segmentation so on and so forth post go live we also have five to six months of as you mentioned support being involved they won't be after go live a lot of technical issues hopefully because it's basically as we do the testing and the user acceptance.\n\n Small business. Small business facilitation. Exactly. Small adoption. Adoption, working with the users, etc. So that's the plan.

If you have really a good maintenance SME within your company, he understand fully this process and the system, and you prepare really a good PowerPoint, simple PowerPoint, what we're doing now, what we want to do in the future, and why, and what is the business benefit, a number of slides. We need to do one for the top management, one for the engineers because if we need to involve the sites SMEs we need also to ensure that the maintenance manager of the site understand what we're talking about not only the main office of each company because sometimes there are let's say lack of communication and lack of understanding between the main office of the companies and the sites not because of a competency issue or a communication issue, maybe because people are overloaded and they have other priorities and we did not engage the maintenance managers to support us to release the SMEs.\n\n In this case, we're talking about, I'm thinking also loud now, the planners would be each discipline, Mohamad. It cannot be one central. I don't know how the central planning is organized in the site. I left So we need to check the central planning, how it's done for the different disciplines. Is it managed by one planning manager or not? Maybe each company is different. As I said, we start with downstream, one big company like Atnocas and Onshore upstream.\n\n We do the remaining companies afterwards. I don't know if you have also in your, let's say, scenarios, should we consider that if there is a big rejection from doing this by the planner, could we go with only a statistical forecast? Will this be accepted to ATNOC? Or the maintenance planner's involvement is must or is good to have? This also should think of this scenario. I don't know if I'm making any sense, Mohamad.\n\n No, no, absolutely."},{"start_time":1732275272935,"end_time":1732275358943,"speaker":{"name":"Mohamad Naamani (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Now, part of the answer, I'll cover and Khalid and Vignesh would do the rest. Because I don't think the planners' involvement or leveraging the solution is optional. But basically, we need to align on where it makes sense, where it's helping, and how to, for them to adopt it. Because definitely, this is across ADNOC as a decision and a solution. And we also owe those, the planners, all the training and support they'll understand.\n\n From our side, definitely we have within our extended team SMEs that can help, as you mentioned, to refer to support this team, the technical and process with some examples or any info related to maintenance, whether we're talking and also drilling, so on and so forth. So that's definitely included. From your side as ATNOC, I think Khalid and Vignesh, so we were working the last couple of days with the core team from headquarters but also to identify, as you mentioned, from different group companies and different disciplines, let's say, or functions, who would be the leads from that perspective.\n\n So it's very valid, and as we move more to interactive sessions, those resources will be key.
