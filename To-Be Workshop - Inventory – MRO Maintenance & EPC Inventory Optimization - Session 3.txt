We are going to start with where we left it, okay? So, just a reminder of what we were reviewing in the last session. So, we said there are three curve distribution models that the system can choose automatically to use based on the demand pattern, which means demand frequency and variability. So we have the normal distribution, the gamma distribution, and the Poisson distribution.\n\n Of course, gamma distribution and normal distribution are for products with higher consumption than Poisson. So during this session, we're going to focus in Poisson distribution. As you can see here, why we're going to focus on the Poisson distribution is because these this distribution was created by SAP specifically to address spare parts, which have a very sporadic and unpredictable demand. So, this is why we're focusing on this distribution.\n\n So, a question we need to â€“ I mean, a point and a feature of IVP we need to highlight from AdNoc deciding which model to use. The system will learn, using mature learning, will learn the different demand patterns and will choose automatically the distribution model that fits better, okay? So if you're thinking, how are we going to define the best distribution models for each one of our parts, well, there's no need.\n\n The system will do it automatically."},{"start_time":1729663952558,"end_time":1729663970264,"speaker":{"name":"Nishant Keloth (Borouge)"},"words":"So this is this is the this is the AI capability or the ML capability that you have for this tool, right?

Say for example if it is an FMCG sort of a company maybe a consumption of you know a monthly consumption may be you know considered fast but for our sort of industry even when a spare part is used once in a year or twice in a year, it is considered. So how does the system know, you know, is there some configuration you set in the system where this many consumptions or movement in a year is considered as fast?\n\n"},{"start_time":1729664023764,"end_time":1729664061767,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Is there any such thing that you need to set? No, there's no need to do that. The system, because the system like kind of draw these distribution for each one of the products, and if the system finds that the consumption is following this pattern, then it will choose this, and so on and so forth. And as you say, if a product is consumed one every year or one every three years, the curve, the distribution, is this one, okay?\n\n Because in almost all the periods there is no consumption."},{"start_time":1729664062505,"end_time":1729664072409,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Fine.

So during this demo, we're going to focus in your, we're going to take your examples, OK? We're going to review some examples, but we're going to review slow movers, meaning consumption. Years and every five years and then medium movers a consumption every one year and every two years and then fast mover which is average demand per year six and two okay for each one of these cases we're going to review two lead times nine and 15 months okay nine months because it's your average and 15 months is arbitrary but something like of course above your average lead time.\n\n And then, again, for all these cases, we're going to review two service levels, 95% and 50%, okay? So what we're going to do here is to show how the system works using the Poisson distribution, which a set is going to be, at least for your spare parts, for chemicals can be different, but for spare parts, definitely will the main model to use. Very exceptional, I guess, with high consumption items we'll use a distribution different than Poisson, okay?\n\n So, is it clear what we're going to review now? We're going to review the result of the reorder point in the safety stock as an output of the system following this these three parameters, these variable parameters, average demand per year, lead time and service level.

One is with the normal service level that we were here on the last session, like 95%. But we also wanted to prepare something with a low service level so you can see that the values can drop to what you are expecting in some cases. OK. So let me make it be here. And let's start with this. This will be great because Here we will show also the functionality of the scenarios.\n\n We have been talking about what-if scenarios. Well, here we have what-if the service level is different, and we have exactly the same values, the same key years, all the same values, but with two different service levels. We can see how the inputs are changing because of that. For those of you that doesn't know, this is IVP. This is what we call a planning view. You can connect to the system just using the add-in that you In the future, the ones that are going to be users are going to have this Excel add-in, and just with an user and password, you can access to your system.\n\n You will find these templates that are basically Excel spreadsheets to what you can connect to the Cloud, basically. All the information that you see here on the planning view is coming from the Cloud. It's not storing in your computer. It's coming from IDP directly, so you can upload information, download information, see exactly what you want to see and not more than that, and so on. So this is the whole functionality.\n\n Now, the example that you are checking here is what we prepare for inventory. We have some inputs related to what is the demand, what is the lead time, the amount of the lead time, and the service level that we are checking for two scenarios. First of all, we are going to use the service level 95 for everything and two lead times. So we will see how it reacts into nine months lead time and to 15 months lead time.\n\n So we also have the order here for fast movers, medium mover, slow movers. We are not considering them moving. We assume that we are not going to have stock there. And for the fast movers, probably you want to see the consumption per year. So this is how many pieces are we consuming per year. Here we have a very fast mover in your case. Consuming six pieces a year, okay? Then in another scenario, we are going to have one that is consuming two pieces a year.\n\n That is the limit for fast movers. Then you start with the medium movers. You have one consumption per year. So here you want to see the yearly frequency because then the consumption per year is going to be very low, of course. So you want to see, for example, that this is consumed every one year. This is consumed every two years. And slow-movers, we are preparing an example with every three years and every five years.\n\n These are the numbers that we are inputting here. The lead time is what you see, what we are already saying, 9 and 15 for all the cases, and then this is the calculated lead time demand. With these numbers, the lead time demand that we calculated and the service level is that we are able to get different numbers. Some cases, for example, for fast movers, what we are getting is that the safety stock for something that is consumed like six times a year, the safety stock is going to be three, and the reorder point is going to be eight.\n\n So probably this is not the most common case for you, right? This is not something very common.

Only on the case that we are going to continue for some materials where the order point planning is that we are going to look for this measure and we are going to integrate this back to S4HANA.\n\n All right, then let's continue with this.

I'll just keep one. And if it is repairable, I'll repair first.\n\n If it is not repairable, then only I will go ahead and buy. So that input, what we discussed in that last meeting, what we are trying to do is give you IPPs proposal of how you can segment material based upon FMSN characteristics. Or whether it is fast-moving, slow-moving, medium-moving, or non-moving, then show you from a value perspective how it is getting categorized based upon value. You already have HML classification, high, medium, low, from a value perspective.\n\n And then the yearly frequency or the consumption pattern, what we are having, how it is consuming based upon in last one year, last four years, or whatever period we decide based on consumption. So we can come up with a matrix. This matrix will help you identify the parts which are falling in which category.

So based upon that discussion we will propose segmentation and then based on segmentation we can decide how we want to treat the next action in IBP for the segmentation based upon the value, based upon the consumption pattern, based upon the frequency of movement.

Now one decision we need to take in IBP is whether you are going use reorder point planning or advanced supply planning from IP. These are two different planning mechanisms.\n\n If you use reorder point planning, which means that the moment inventory goes below your reorder point planning, you want to automatically trigger the purchase requisition. That's an MRP feature, which means that if we decide that out of 100 parts, 50 parts would be on reorder point planning, SAP will not do supply planning. And we will define the reorder point minimum and maximum levels. So that when the MRP runs, the moment the consumption happens and inventory goes below the reorder point planning, it will trigger the purchase requisition and you can procure the material.\n\n Now, if for the remaining 50 parts, if we do the advanced supply planning, then generally IBP does not consider the maximum stock level. It will create proposal based upon the constraints you have in the planning. But if one of the constraints you want to put that you want IBP to always consider max level as planning in advanced supply planning as well, then we can also use that as one of the constraint to make sure that IBP will never propose a purchase verification which will lead to the inventory more than the max planning.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729667773852,"end_time":1729667787734,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Actually, there is two points here.

This is 0 or point? This is point, isn't it? 0.1 in this case. It's very low. Let me jump into this discussion because this is the most important, I think. As I was saying recently, service level is where we can influence the calculation. It's a very important topic in the calculation and whatever is not in the formula, we can put it through the service level.\n\n It's going to be mostly a strategic decision because of the thing that you're saying that as long movers we are not keeping stock so we are going to put a service level very low or zero so we don't give you a proposal on those cases. So usually service level is related to a risk score that we calculate. Risk score is basically telling you what is the impact that is took out can have on the operation.\n\n So number one is going to be the riskier one. So probably for the number one, we want to have a high service level and make sure that we have the necessary stock. And then number two is a lower priority and so on. And you can go even to number six or lower. And you say, for number six, you are not keeping any stock. So this is what we want to achieve. And it's going to depend on the segmentations.\n\n These are the segmentations that you already have. The idea is that for every combination of material and plant, we can know through the segmentations that you see here, and other parameters that we can discuss right now, in which RISC score we should assign this to try to automate these decisions on the system. It's what Raful was trying to state before, that this should be automatic. So it should be and rules like for, I don't know, for slow moving, we don't need to keep safety stock.\n\n So that is a rule in the system, and automatically for every slow mover, it's not going to propose, because we are going to assign a lower risk score and a very low service level, so we achieve what you are expecting. What you see here is basically the segmentations you have, and what we've seen could be the stock-out impact, This is something that we did prior to the discussion that we have on Monday.\n\n We were thinking that the most important one for you was the BED, that is state in the criticality. But I think that one that may be more important, you can correct me, is the frequency segmentation based on what we are discussing is the segmentation that we are discussing the most lately. Then you have the other segmentation like the ABC, the consumption value, or HML, the unit price, that you can also use as a means to define if this is important or not, and so on.\n\n There are other segmentations that we think that they are less critical. We are keeping lead time segmentation because in one point we were discussing at the beginning, but we think that the impact is going to be very, very low. You don't need to consider that. Indeed, it's already considered as part of the formula, so we don't need to consider an additional lead time segmentation. So here is where we want to enter to this discussion.\n\n I think that in the last session, we are going in that direction indeed. Just an example, don't take it, it's just an example to state what I was trying to say. So we are thinking, for example, if vital is something that we need to have a stock always because we have a direct impact on the operation, then this is the riskier one. And in consequence, we need to assign a very high service level. And then you see that fast moving is the next priority or the value.\n\n If this is very expensive and so on, this can be totally wrong, probably it is. The idea is that based on the segmentation, we are defining the criticality on this risk, and then we define the target service level. Now, we need to come up with our version of this matrix. It's just to give you an example that you need to understand that we want to define our risk score in a service level based on the segmentation, But right now, we need to come up with this matrix.\n\n I don't know if it's in the same session or you want to discuss it internally. I think that we will require some time because they are multiple AGCs. But this is what we are trying to achieve. There was a question before I jump to the printout. I think I had a question.

We were doing some brainstorming. We were determining that based on the frequency, we can decide. We can decide also based on the material type, based on the cost that I think that is the HTML.\n\n You can correct me. Okay, is that one? Okay, perfect. And you were mentioning also the usage data. So here we already find something that we are not expecting. For example, this is not a segmentation, this is a characteristic of the material, right? So repairable is out of the equation right away we put it with this case automatically. This is what we want to achieve. Now the idea, if you can discuss, if you can think which other segmentation we should use and which parameters in them so we can come up with these cases that you have here and assign the proper service level so we can achieve this.\n\n As you see in the system, we are proposing things like that.

One is reorder point planning, which depends more on SAP to run MRP.\n\n And second is advanced supply planning, which depends on IBP to plan the material.

And then the life is simpler for such materials. And then the materials which are more important can go to the advanced supply planning.\n\n And then we do the supply planning as we discussed in the subsequent session there.

And that aggregation will help you decide the segregation, whether it is a, what should be the inventory level, because the inventory level should be triggered at plant level.\n\n So this is just an additional information to decide on a strategic level, how you want to negotiate with the vendor, whether the total quantity, but then this will not drive actual reorder point setup or safety stock setup, because you cannot define reorder point safety stock at group company. Level it has to be decided at the plant level yes but we can make the PR on the aggregate on the corporate level yeah so so when we do the supply planning probably we need to look at the demand at at the corporate level corporate corporate level ad hoc level oh corporate level we can show either at ad hoc level or at both the levels we can see what is the demand and then when the proposal the purchase requisition is to be now the purchase Another thing, when you create a proposal, it can be one purchase requisition, say 100 quantity, but then across 10 plants, you want to have 10 quantities across 10 plants.\n\n So the actual PRs are triggered at plant level because you need inventory in the plant. So IDP will show you, you need 100 quantity. So probably when you negotiate with the vendor, you talk about 100 quantity for AdNoc, but then you would need 10 separate PRs because you're procuring at the plant level, right? Should go to that specific plant. Or we can have one PR with 10 line items."},{"start_time":1729669774514,"end_time":1729669825982,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"That's something more technical. For me, having PR on 10 level item bots, we have to provide reporters. So as Aysha was explaining, as a team leader or department managers, we have to review how the inventory controller gives this number.

I can provide you the the report, consumption data in the last three years, consumption year to date, one year supply, two years supply, three years supply, in addition to the order point and the order quantity, and PR quantity, PO quantity, because maybe there is PR and PO, and at the same time, if there is any reservation.\n\n If I saw all that, I will agree on this line level, I can accept the quantity which is proposed by the inventory controller, or I will amend Yeah, agreed."},{"start_time":1729669825982,"end_time":1729669859227,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So I think, let me summarize what we discussed so that we are all on the same page.

We've reviewed in detail the formulas which IVP use and the logic which IBP use based upon historical consumption.\n\n It proposes what algorithms to be used. And poison algorithm is most suitable as per SAP for intermittent consumption where you have very less quantity consumed over large period. Now, we've looked at how poison will predict the reorder point safety stock and other min-max parameters based upon what historically it is consumed. We've also looked at how IBP can help you segment the materials and based upon the segmentation we can have a follow-up action whether it has to be reorder-based funding, whether it has to be advanced supply planning and we've also looked at how based upon the segmentation we can specify whether the order point has to be 01, which is in line with your current inventory policies.\n\n So are we all comfortable with what we have discussed in last two sessions, three sessions on inventory planning?
