UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hey man, how are

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I'm fine. Hi, Hector.

Hector Palacios:
Doing well, man. Doing well. Finally, I finished my meetings, so I'm really happy because I was sleeping poorly these days.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Oh, I found you online all the time.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, that's why I was answering like 8 p.m. Here, you know, something like that. Sometimes that happens, you know.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Hector Palacios:
8 p.m. For me. I don't know if for you was common in the last job but consultancies like sometimes you have peaks of jobs and sometimes you have nothing to do.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
No, I didn't use for that but it's okay for me.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, yeah, there are going to be challenges. It's not that they They are telling you to work more, of course, but if you feel the pressure for having something nice for tomorrow, you know, you tend to do that. At least that's my case. But it's up to you at the end. Maybe I'm not really good at managing my time in the proper way, so I end up doing this on the last day. I don't know.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I think you are a good person.

Hector Palacios:
Let's see. Okay, so you told me that they already transferred you money for buying the laptop, right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, sorry for being at the street now, but I go to buy it, buy the laptop, and I am waiting for for the store to install the windows and the office and then I after one hour I will receive

Hector Palacios:
the laptop all right so you're right you already bought it I bought it okay yes I bought it it's uh e14 yeah okay great man great would you know that you already will have the laptop and for that it is not an issue man if you are like on the street or anything that you need to enjoy the good part of working remote. If you have a meeting in which you don't need to share the screen, you can go for a walk and just talk from the phone.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
I would recommend to do that. I am stable now. I am in a cafe. It's OK if I can open the camera.

Hector Palacios:
No, no, no. Don't worry. Don't worry, because I will get exposed, and right now, in the best condition to show the camera you know oh okay yes you know that that's uh that's remote working one-on-one sometimes you are in pyjamas pyjamas you know for opening the camera we should accept that yeah yeah that that's a new normal that's the reality right now yes okay man so let's see let me see the points because I'm I'm I'm always keeping track of the points I have with my team.

 So let me check, because I created a list with you. I need to add you to that list. I need to create a group between us so you have also the access to see all these tasks. So I have these points, for example, for GoSCMI-VP. I think that I already gave you the credentials, right? Were you able to see them? That you could access with that?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
For example, yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I didn't check.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I waited for the laptop and I will receive from Omar the files today. Maybe also I met him him. I will try to meet him to install it.

Hector Palacios:
OK, no problem. No problem. So let's let's keep it open until you have the laptop during tomorrow. Maybe we can check in some minutes if you have access and all of that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. OK.

Hector Palacios:
OK. So you have the data.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Have you been able to check some videos? Yes. I checked the I finished three videos which are about the planning view and creating a planning queue. Also, I didn't move forward to the other topic. I searched for the same topic on YouTube. I think I found better videos, but I will do both. I will keep Guta versus the reference, but I will You need some videos from YouTube beside them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Are you a fan of SharedDVD? I used the newest one, DeepSeek. Okay. It doesn't matter which one.

Hector Palacios:
The point is that there is some big knowledge based on that sometimes we can use. For example, there is a page that is called SAP Health. And you have a lot of information about IVP. So what I do sometimes is that I download the information as a PDF, and I upload it to SAP DB. So I can get the answers. I have a chatbot for IVP, basically. So it's something that you can do. But let's say tomorrow when you have the laptop, Maybe I can show you that page if you have any questions.



Abdurahman Hamdy:
OK. Will we have with our accounts the TGVD, the advanced one or the free one?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Hector Palacios:
Sadly, they are putting some constraint there because I'm using TGVD and I'm paying for it for myself. But the company is not paying because they say that we have some compliance issue related to security of information. Usually the clients don't like it. It's like the Uber, you know? It's the future, but everyone is not easy to put in place at the beginning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes.

Hector Palacios:
But I think that we can still use the free version. I'm sure that it's going to add a lot of value. And so let's meet tomorrow, because I have some tips as well so if you're taking some youtube videos I know for example how to get a transcription for free of the youtube video so you can get a summary of that and so on so it's easier for you to check information uh and sometimes you don't need to see the whole video to find your answer you know I don't care like that so I get the the transcript I upload it to chat dbt and I ask Is it mentioning about this?

 If it is not, then I don't see the video.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Some tips so you can learn faster.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Thank you.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Okay.

Speaker 1:
I asked Omar to be your buddy.

Hector Palacios:
So officially it is. So as we were saying that this is a silly thing, you know, but because in your case, Omar is your friend. So I was, I completely sure that was going to happen either way. But Omar is your official link to OSCM. Aside of me, of course, but it's like it's going to be your buddy on the company. Okay. So that's great. And it's already communicated. Pre-assignment is still ongoing.

 Let me check because I think that Yara was writing to me.

Hector Palacios:
Yeah, she was telling me that probably you are going to be to that project that I told you, Araby. OK. But it's not confirmed. But this is very likely, I would say. OK. So let's wait for that. Let's keep it open. What else I have? I need to schedule the meetings. I haven't. But I will schedule probably on Tuesday and Thursday every week. Just to have a close follow-up with you at the beginning, okay?

 The laptop you are resolving, and I think that's for now, man. I have another point on my list.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Do you have anything that you want to check?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Again, please, Hector.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Those are all my points that I have right now. Do you have anything that you want to ask or to add? Yes. May I ask for two points, please? Yeah. First one, at first I sent to Yara the price of E16, but when I go to the store, I found that the difference between E16 and E14 is that it's bigger in size and I I thought that the smaller one is better and lighter so I decided to buy the smaller one and also I found a better price so now I have around 300 dollars remain so how can I return them?

 So the new laptop is inside of the this is cheaper cheaper yes cheaper with the 380 dollars oh yeah is it better better for better than the other one because you say that you are changing the laptop just the

Hector Palacios:
size the screen size ah the screen size I I think we can communicate I I don't see that it's going to be a big issue So please just write an email, put me on copy. So if they have any issue, I can push for that, OK?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
But if this is outside the budget, no problem. Yes, the remaining money, what should I do?

Hector Palacios:
They already sent you some money, right? Yes, they sent me extra money. OK, the difference? Yeah, let's request the difference right now. An email to Yara, if you are checking this with Yara, write an email to her, saying that you found a better one and there is a little difference, so if they can, how do you say?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
They talk to them for the difference? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they need to pay the difference, right?

Hector Palacios:
So if this is inside the budget, they need to give you the additional money, right? They need to pay for the laptop. So if there is any missing amount, then let's ask for that, for a reimbursement.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Just write an email explaining and ask for the difference so they can... No, no, no. I have extra. I have extra with me. You have extra? Yes okay then they are going to love it okay this guy is very honest send an email send an email send an email and say okay I have this uh extra money because the laptop was cheaper and better uh how can I probably they are going to say um keep the money and then we discount it from the salary from the next one okay but write an email so so they can know how to to proceed.

 I'm not sure what's the scenario here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, I'm writing that point so we can follow up later. What is the next one?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
I will just make the store to prepare the invoice and then I will send the email. Yeah, perfect. Okay. The second point please because I think for working the full day studying maybe not in the optimum for me. Can we mix between studying and another task if there is any task or even if it's a repeated task or something that I can support then I can shift between studying and any task that may make the performance better.



Hector Palacios:
Okay, so you want to see if you can help in any project with something, right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I think this, for me, studying both time, maybe after some hours, it's not in high performance. Maybe if I shift between studying and tasks, maybe it will be better.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, okay.

Hector Palacios:
Look, the best way for you, I mean, I'm much better studying at night. For me, that works much better. My focus is like 100% or 120%. Morning, I'm not really good. So you decide what is the best for you. And related to additional tasks. Let me check. I think that Sebastian is leaving today probably. Let me check with Sebastian, otherwise I will ask Omar to work with you maybe. So maybe at the beginning you can support Omar.

 I think that is the best possibility. Okay, so let me check that option and maybe he will tell me. No, Hector, I'm if I have now Abdulrahman. Abdulrahman is my friend, but right now I'm like fully committed, you know. Let me check with him. Let me check with him. I don't know how he's doing right now. Okay. But let me see where you can start helping a little bit, all right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

Hector Palacios:
Okay, so let me check if let me see tomorrow yeah I think that maybe we can have some time I don't want to be bothering you on friday very late no no it's okay anytime anytime okay because sometimes I I have a meeting with santiago it's usually 30 minutes but with santiago I spend like one hour always It's not a good idea to put just after the Santiago meeting because I'm going to fail you. Let me put one.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
For me, it's okay. Anytime.

Hector Palacios:
I will put one. Let me know if it is okay, man. Okay. But what we are missing is to get to know each other because I was like too accelerated yesterday and was talking about everything about jobs. But let's meet tomorrow. Let's check our points and let's take time. To discuss and to get to know each other. So I can tell you a little bit about me and about you, all right? Yes, okay, thank you. Okay, let me put one meeting for tomorrow and we can have that discussion.

 All right, man, I don't know if you have any other point that we can check right now, otherwise... No, all is good now. All right, it's good. So you can focus on the laptop and tomorrow, hopefully, we connect and you are with the new laptop, all right?

Abdurahman Hamdy:
Yes, I hope that. I will go to now, return to the store. I will try my best to meet Omar to install the new tools and tomorrow will be OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, perfect.

Hector Palacios:
All right, so let's leave it here and let's connect tomorrow again, all right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, OK.

Abdurahman Hamdy:
OK, thank you. Have a nice day. You too.

Speaker 1:
Bye-bye.

Speaker 1:
Bye!
