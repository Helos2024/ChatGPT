There were some comments that Arun was taking, but I I don't know if you also seen it, that said that as we know the comments that AdNoc made on the documentation of the Wave 1, then we can review the documentation of the Wave 2 and take some advantage or advance on the comments that they may do.

So, for example, the snapshots. We can define snapshots right away for the purchasing plan and for the distribution plan. So, I think Arun and Fiamma were the ones taking those points. So I don't know, Arun, Fiamma, one of you can also, if he's not there, add that part of the snapshots in the BRD for supply and inventory.\n\n You mean the ones that we did in the demo?"},{"start_time":1734356408785,"end_time":1734356410494,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Or which ones?"},{"start_time":1734356410503,"end_time":1734356478146,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"You can take a look maybe and you can copy and paste in just a little bit. So there's, I added a section for the snapshots in the video of the Managed Inventory. It's basically replicate that, but instead of using the forecast as, or I think I used the reorder point. Instead of using the reorder point, use the purchasing plan distribution plan. It's just because we're clear that at least we're going to use the snapshots for that or for the purchasing plan for the distribution plan.\n\n Later maybe we will expand the snapshots for other key figures but at least as an initial definition that's it. I don't know Hector if you can think about something else that was highlighted or corrected during the sessions we had? No, I don't know. I don't know if that is going to save us time or give us more work, to be honest."},{"start_time":1734356478146,"end_time":1734356535237,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Maybe it's better to wait for the comments on the side, and we can react, knowing that they are not going to put as much pressure as they did before, because now they are lying that we need to progress to close and we need to configure. So maybe with that in mind, they are not going to be as difficult as before. I expect less comments, hopefully. So if we start checking all the comments that they did in order to get some recommendation, maybe we are going to take more time than needed.\n\n So unless it's pretty clear, Vashti, I don't have like points clear, but if there is something really clear that can be questioned, yes, let's go ahead."},{"start_time":1734356537192,"end_time":1734356546021,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Here, there is something very specific that they mentioned.

I need to check with SEWA if finally, because that is on the list of the deliverables of the construction of a stage.\n\n But I'm not sure if there is a, can you hear me well? But I need to check if there is a specific format, because I don't know how are you used to take this point. But for my side, I'm used to use just the configuration plan. And as long as you are configuring, then you do the unit testing using that. Then the script, we do it for the UIT or the integral tests, but not for the unit testing.

So if we can start with a base list of scenarios that we can check internally that they are working, then we are going to be more comfortable for the next stages.\n\n It's going to be more smooth."},{"start_time":1734356865900,"end_time":1734356876364,"speaker":{"name":"Rocio Minguillon"},"words":"Okay, so do you agree that maybe this week we can also put this into our priorities to work on?"},{"start_time":1734356876364,"end_time":1734356896306,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Yes, yes, yes, I think so.

So the thing is that what I need to prepare in this next couple of and it's something that I will discuss with Arun and Sagar, are basically the key points, the key milestone, the key requirements for APNOC to anticipate the goal life of drilling. So we need to, of course, the plan is to do it in May. And of course, considering all the restrictions constraints we have, it is not possible that we can address every single requirement and do the goal like we made.\n\n So of course, I'm thinking about an MVP. And the question then is how we basically balance these two approaches that we have. On one hand, this MVP plan and on the other hand, other hand, the go-live anticipation for drilling."},{"start_time":1734357037316,"end_time":1734357045200,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Do you want to have that meeting before with KPMG?"},{"start_time":1734357045200,"end_time":1734357086863,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"No, I want first us to be clear on how we're going to approach it. I'm not seeing plan defined responsible. I'm not seeing how we can like align these two things because they look pretty similar. So how are we going to take it?

But that doesn't mean that. I mean, I agree with you in that the For example, we will have unit testing in the next couple of weeks once we finish the configuration. Probably this will be without integration, most likely. I mean, it will be very likely. It's very unlikely that we will have an integration for that. And it's up to us to decide if we want to include key users into that testing.\n\n So for me, that is a good opportunity to address the MVP plan.

But I don't know if we have to wait until that to say the thing about the MVP, or if we should have a meeting to start putting that idea on demand.

That's why I was requesting you to put the high-level plan. Now that we have, can go with a meeting with Namani, explain the situation, what we are expecting, and then we can align when we should put this. And I think that this is important because maybe this can influence the final plan that they are trying to close. So let's have it at high level.\n\n I think that let's have a meeting with Namani just to discuss, align with the idea of the MVP, that then we should postpone any further Because I know that the guys are expecting, no, we should have everything and tested and so on. They are crazy, but that's what they are asking. So we need to find the sweet spot.

So for the first point, definition of the data table for MRP area. So basically, we need to see which all MRP area tables, basically, where the plant and MRP area combination we can get in the SAP. So that table, we need to see which all MRP area tables, basically, we need to see which all MRP area tables, basically, where the plant and MRP area combination we can get in the SAP.\n\n So that is the first point. Second is like virtual extractors that will be modified. Basically example lock underscore ext. So that we have to modify so that similarly the least is the second point. The third point defined applicability to project so. In this point. What exactly is required like, If we found five extractors, which need to be modified. So we just have to see like that file is still applicable for the ad hoc scenario.\n\n Something like that or.
