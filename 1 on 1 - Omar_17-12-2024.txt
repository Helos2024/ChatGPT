So you don't do appropriate amount of planning.\n\n You calculate an inventory, take the stock, and reorder point for them. And supply planning is basically reorder point.

It still is a mess. We are trying to organize it to do some reality checks because the people is not committing a lot. They are not taking responsibilities. It's not clear who is the decision maker. Too many companies, too many people, too many involved. At least we are closing the design. We are pushing and EPMD is taking a more, a better role in not taking requirements or asking AdNoc to take responsibility.\n\n So that is getting better for sure. Let's say that it's a working process because we need to have a reality check with them. There are too many companies and they are expecting that for life all of them are going to be ready and with all the data validated despite that they have millions or material, so it's kind of unrealistic. But sooner or later, they will realize that it's not that easy as they think.\n\n One good trick, Omar, is that when you are in a project, you need to give them tasks, always. So if you keep everything on your side, they will start saying, OK, but why you don't have a tray, and so on.

They ask that. We can do it. But please, I will send you a template, and you load it. Because the moment they ask, no, no, but I can provide you access, that is a mess. Because then it's a lot to research, to ask them, is this filter OK, and so on. Instead, when you give them the table, and they need to load it, they are thinking that.\n\n They are, in a way, they are putting all the filters to an all the transformations, the things that you require on integration, they are doing it manually. At the same time, they are delivering the data, and they are validating the data, because they will send you something that makes sense to them. So you are like three steps ahead. If you need to do that, then you need to do the transformation. You need to be asking for the filters, because you don't know if what make sense or not, because they are the owners of the data, not you.\n\n And then the validation, then you need to load the data on the system, they need to tell you, no, this doesn't make sense, you know.

You become the bottleneck. And that is not what you want. And then also they can question you. Why you are complaining if you have a whole team behind?\n\n I think that the first thing that you need to do is try to make sure that all the ones that are below you are full of tasks. If they are not able to get it, then you start doing things. Know, but that's the important part, like to make sure that everyone below is having something to do.

But yes, as soon as there are things that are open like data, like open definitions, data quality, that's for sure one big one.\n\n Users, availability, and all of that, you need to start asking them to provide you that. We need to be pushing with them. It's not that the project is something that they need to understand from the beginning that a project is something that is a partnership. It's not that I'm paying you, you need to do everything. It's not like that. We are working together in getting this done. It's not like starting Excel.\n\n It's not plug and play, you know?

It's much more diverse than Spain, I would say, because of the sea, because it's a big part of the continent, let's say. It's not a big country, I mean, but it's long, so it takes a lot of climate on the same continent.\n\n But for sure, Spain is much, much more dense historically on the cities.

And for me, OK, this is not a small town. It's a big town for me. Now, you have then barcelona and madrid they are megatowns they are like too big you know and el cairo for for sure is is like that as well but uh on chile we have only santiago and then after santiago is the the cities are not real big I think that in egypt probably is the same right aside of el cairo and maybe you have some big cities but not that big yeah yeah we don't But we have, like,"},{"start_time":1734450619019,"end_time":1734450639993,"speaker":{"name":"Omar Essam"},"words":"main cities in the south.

Valencia was much better in that regard but they like the beach in Spain and they also they realize that people is not really friendly.\n\n In Spain in general, not only on Barcelona, they would say that also from Madrid. Now the point is that Barcelona is against tourists because it's so famous that so many tourists are They are like renting Airbnbs and the Airbnb is making that the whole supply of houses is lower than the renting prices is higher, you know? So it's giving them a lot of issues in reality. And they don't like tourists and they have protests and all that.\n\n So just this year there was like a big, big protest protest against tourists in Barcelona. So that's why the people is not really nice with us. And historically, they also want to be in our country because they feel that in the past they were a different reign. They speak another language as well. So they have like a national thing. Yeah, Catalan. So they would like to be in our country. And that is is generating a lot of like conflict between the Spain in general and then they want they want independence you know so that's why yeah that's why when they when you are checking the Real Madrid against Barcelona team is such a big event because there is a inherent conflict between Barcelona and Madrid and and when but and when Spain for example the national football team is playing, Barcelona is against Spain.\n\n They are expecting New York to win, you know?

Then you need to go to the city of the art. That's great. Very, very beautiful. It's like my favorite place in Spain. And then you need to go to the historical center. But the historical center is not going to be like Barcelona or Madrid.\n\n It's similar. So probably your impression is not going to be that big. So I wouldn't dedicate a lot of time to that because it's like you have seen that. And there is like one big park that is called Turia.

I don't know if I presented you, like, this slide once. In the past, I don't remember. Here I'm missing only one thing. Well, here we are explaining, like, many things, like, the step of the process, where you are, you know, supply, how in the end-to-end, what are the parts that we are doing. This is what's done by KPMG. This the input the iteration about the well that that is not really relevant as data for the demo it's not that relevant but this is not the presentation that you need to prepare indeed because you are not presenting to people that doesn't know what you should do here is you have a one slide with the supply chain network and explaining what are the explains what are the basic inputs that you have.\n\n And you can place the input around here.
