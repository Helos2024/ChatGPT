UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello, good morning. Good morning, Mohammed. Hello. Hello. Hi, good morning. Good morning. Hi everyone. Bye. You.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think we'll just give it a few more minutes to wait for everyone else to join the call. Hello everyone, good morning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Morning.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
you Good morning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Good morning, Diego. Good morning, Diego. Good morning.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Ty, do you know if Asma and Alia will be joining? Yes, Ms. Alia is not available today, but Ms.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Asma is joining soon.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, we'll just wait for her.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Guys, Asma will join shortly, so we can start, I believe, until she joins in.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you very much, Sharma. OK, sure. Thanks, Mohammed. So thanks, everyone, for joining this call this morning. The purpose of today's discussion is to outline all of the roles that are associated with the demand, inventory, and supply planning processes. And we need to try and determine the level at which these roles would sit at. So if they're going to sit at AGC level or at plant level, et cetera.

 We would also be discussing the approval process and which role the approval will sit at. And we would also like to try and establish the sizing of the role in terms of the headcount. And we would like to try to identify the key or end users of each of those roles. So I'm just going to share my screen. Please let me know once you can see it.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We can see it. Okay, great.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So what I have over here is, I'll just zoom out for a second, but we have the different modules over here. So we have demand planning, inventory planning, and supply planning. And then we have MRO at the top, followed by chemicals, and then drilling and tying. And under each of these, we have the different roles. We have, for example, demand planning. We have demand request and demand manager. We then have a description of the role.

 So what are the duties or responsibilities of the role? We then have the level. So this is where we will determine what level this role would sit at. As I said earlier, whether it's at AGC level, plant level, shared services level, et cetera. We then have a column over here where we would mark where the approval actually lies. We would then want to try and establish the headcounts or the number of people that would belong to this role, followed by the identification of key or end users.

 Is that clear to everyone? Does anyone have any questions on this?

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Just to explain what is the difference between that headcount and users?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So headcount is the actual number. And users would actually be the number of the people that would belong to the role.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Number of people who is going to use count.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, so here the description is stuck under the main heading, so this would be the number of employees that would be associated with the role, and this would actually be the identification.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So the names of such employees. OK.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so I will leave the discussion and then the technical team role and go see more. Contribute towards the discussion. So I think if we could start with demand planning under MRO. So the first role is the demand requester. So this role is responsible for managing the forecasting process for MRO parts, including reviewing the statistical forecast generated by the system and reviewing the demand materials.

 The first part in which we need to confirm is the level at which role will sit at. Rahul, I don't know if you want to add any further context to that.

Patel, Rahul:
No, I think you've covered, so if we can help, if we can get more information at which level this role is sitting from an R perspective, that will help us size us the role and identify number of users.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
That's one thing, guys, here. We have to fill this now, right?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yes, the aim is to try and get as much of this done as we can during this session.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Perfect.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
OK, now with regards to the first point, I believe it pertains to the end user. And at site, who's doing the plan for the requirement? So it should be ATC, if I'm not mistaken.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Patel, Rahul:
A question here, when you say ATC, is it like one user per ATC, or we'll have one user per plant or plant section.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I believe demand can come from each department or team, so access should be given to every department of the agency.

Patel, Rahul:
So here we are looking at a more granular level at a department level within NGC. So let's take an example just for the benefit of this conversation. If we take onshore or offshore as an example, then there can be multiple plants within that and the multiple departments. So that each department will have a user identified.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
even in onshore we have multiple fields and terminals and in the field and terminal there are multiple departments. So we have to request the management to nominate The number of department and number of users.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so every department at each of the agencies there would be a demand requester. Um? I think you can. Can I move on from this one and go to demand manager? Do this and then we can move on to the approval level.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See I think, see we still don't have a very clear picture of it unless we had a detailed discussion with the maintenance side. This is what my understanding is.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Yes Khalid you are right as you remember we provided you the list of all the focal points from the maintenance and operations. So prior to this meeting if a detailed meeting can be arranged with the focal points then it would be added advantage to know the actual scenario.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So I think there is one pending action I think we'll discuss this in the weekly, that is whether the communication has been sent to the leadership first. This was one thing I think which I think even Asma was following up, if you have any details on it. But yeah, so what need to say, I mean this is something which once we connect with them then only we'll have further clarity. We can give a Probably you can give us like an eye level only now, but it will be clear only at that stage.

 And it can vary from what I suspect is can vary from group company to group company.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct me anyway if my understanding is correct.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Especially for the demand side, inventor side I'm sure that there is a clarity with clarity Or we can put put as per our current understanding now and then define it later.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What do you say? Yeah, I think colored I'm wrong.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think if we can do it based on the and then we can have discussions with business and see if it needs to be adjusted.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Afterwards. Yeah, I agree team. This way we have a baseline or a start and then we can fine tune as opposed to have nothing.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Definitely that that works. OK.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Could we move on to the demand manager under MRO? So the demand manager is responsible improving the finalized consolidated demand to ensure its readiness for inventory and supply planning processes.

Patel, Rahul:
Do we know at which level this role would sit at? So here, what we would like to understand is that at what level or how would you expect the demand to be approved. If you say that the users are from the departments, then the demand gets approved by department heads, plant heads, or AGC heads. What do you anticipate when the approval process has to happen? Through what levels the approvals will flow?

 And when we say approval, please note that we are not approving independent transaction. Is not a transaction system. It's a planning system. So when we say the approval, we mean the approval of the demand for that specific AGC or.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
plant or department within the plant? Any feedback, team?

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Before that, one question here in the first level demand requestor. Why it's only AGC? There are some categories going to be central centralized, right? So that category will do by the central team.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, we're discussing about the the initial demand which every department or end user generates on the basis of their maintenance plan like shut down or any kind of project related job. So something which comes from the basic end user. So that's why as per my understanding it should be department level. But the demand manager can be one from a one group company as dominated by the management and he can approach Demand of that group company.



Patel, Rahul:
OK, so you are in between. Sorry, there is no reviewer in between.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
It's from the request directly goes to the Approval for the manager. That's what we would like to understand.

Patel, Rahul:
How would you like us to set this up like this is an input for the process from AdNoc. How AdNoc would like to have this demand reviewed and approved?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
I think we need to have the EWM team here to discuss and agree on this. OK, we are not the right people to decide.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Maybe they need. They have a team leader. They need a reviewer in between.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Whatever it may be, but we have to discuss with the EWM team, not not with you. The planning team may be proposed. What is their plan?

Patel, Rahul:
That's all. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably if we can just get an initial input, what do you recommend? And then for sure, as Khalid mentioned, the communication goes, and then we engage with the team.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We will review this further with them as well. OK. OK.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So are there any suggestions on where this approval should take What are the options? Can you drop down what they are? Sorry, this is just marked with an X at the moment, so I was going to mark it accordingly where, which role would be responsible for that approval.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I mean, you say first is level and then it's for approval.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I didn't understand what's the difference.

Patel, Rahul:
So this is where, OK, go ahead Raul. So when we say levels, we would like to understand that if demand is coming from department, will it go through? Like what Tariq was mentioning, the demand may get approved at AGC level, which means all the demand from respective department gets consolidated, and a single person approves the demand. That's one way of doing things. Or you may have someone in between who reviews it, and then at AGC level, someone approves it.

 So this is something based will have to define that hierarchy in the process so that the consolidation happens in the manner. Also here, one of the inputs probably can be that whether we will do this at metal group level or whether we'll do it at a department and plant. Level and IDC level.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
There is some confusion, you know there are two columns of approval, one for the in the approval and the second in the demand manager where you wrote one from each group company. If we can put the role of demand manager in the hands of some department manager or the person who endorse it, as those said, so then it can be adjusted, I believe.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So if I understood you correctly, Tariq, you said it would be at this level over here for the demand manager.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
group company that would do that? Sorry.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Yes, if you shift this one from each group company to the right.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
then the department manager as endorser, then I think it will look good.

Patel, Rahul:
So Kyle, the suggestion is that the department end user would create a demand or do the demand requester role. And then the department manager would be the endorser. And then the AGC level approval will come as a second level of approval.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
final approval. Yes. OK, for the

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
the headcount and the users. I'm not sure if we would be able to do it during this discussion or if we would have to take this back to business and then have these discussions on this.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Rahul? I think so.

Patel, Rahul:
Do we even know on a ball count level how many people we think we should be dealing with here when we say that the demand requester and the department. Is it less than 100? Is it less than 50? Any ballpark number we can foresee here? For sure, we'll get this information eventually, but just to get an idea.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
It depends on company to company. For example, in onshore, we have eight fields and terminals. Total departments if you count like 60 or 65 but in SOAR gas we have one field and like seven or eight department so we have to get this accurate information from the maintenance.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, so Tariq, do we have anything which tells us that summarizes the department for group companies?

Patel, Rahul:
Is this something we can get without talking to end users? A high-level overview here.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Some basic information we provided to Khalid in form of the nominations from the group companies. Almost all group companies are there except Bhuruj. That can give us a general idea about the number of departments. Khalid, if you can share that list. Yeah, I already shared with them.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
And just one thing to hear for information. The nomination is for the time being. It continuously changes by time.

Patel, Rahul:
So what do you mean by what if it changes time by time, which means for now we'll have these people, or during the testing in UoT we'll have the clarity?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
We mean for the time being, we have these people. Might be changed because people are moving from here to there, from different departments across the end user functions. So upon movement, we have to do some certain changes later on.

Patel, Rahul:
So what you are saying, people change, but the roles would remain the same, right? If we say one user per department, the number of users or the number of people required will change, but the actual name may change if a person moves from one department to another.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
The role will be constant. However, the people's name will change, denominations.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, noted. OK.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Rahul, should I stick with the mine planning and go across? Or do you want me to go down to the other roles within MRO itself?

Patel, Rahul:
to the demand planning. I think for operations as well.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I think similar logic will apply a Tariq.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, I believe similar logic. So just to confirm for chemicals, there will be the operations department lead and which will be the endorser and then the last Approver will be the operations manager which will be one per AGC.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Is this correct?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I think for the chemicals scenario is slightly different. Every group company has their own mechanism to create the demand. If I remember, in the meeting with the AGCs, every group company explained how they are generating the demand. So on the basis of that, we have to agree some common mechanism. Yeah, you're correct.

Patel, Rahul:
So we have two ways of getting demand. One is the demand as an input, and second is based upon the historical consumption reorder point level planning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
But then the logic would remain the same. For sure, every group company will have a different way of planning the chemicals. But then can we assume that it would still be at department level, or will it be at AGC level?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Those any comment about this. Sorry, I'm not listening that. What is the question? Discussion. Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, the question here is that for chemicals, the similar to EM, the demand would be at department level. The reviewer would be at department level. Would that be a fair assumption? Yes. A question further, when we say approver, will we have separate approver for chemical demands versus EM demand or the approver at AGC level can be the same for the entire demand? In the department level, it will be different.



Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
But I don't know how they are going to nominate for AGC level. Yes, there is a separate department for planning the chemicals at the AGC.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
in each agency.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And do we have any number of roles.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Or.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For the operations plan and operations manager, or is it similar to tomorrow where we will have to look at the agencies and establish the different departments that exist?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Let's say 20 users because not that much like tomorrow it will be. Only one department maybe in each group company. Let's say 20. Planets.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And in terms of the headcount for the operations managers?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Same. Same.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is for department as well as operations manager?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I mean the approver.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, because we will have, because the MRO will have, let's say the endorser. The endorser will be the department. Let's say lead and then the final approver will be the operations manager, which is one per AGC.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
OK, if it is agreed, I mean there will be one manager to approve Maru, you can approve chemical also.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So one per AGC, so 12.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I'm going to move on to drilling and tile.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So we have the drilling planner who's responsible for demand planning for drilling materials.

Patel, Rahul:
Again, we would need to establish the level at which this role belongs. Will it be department or will it be metal category in drilling?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Category. There is separate department. Also there is a separate department in the offshore.

Patel, Rahul:
So like onshore, offshore, Sargas, Aldaphra and Alisar, these are the five drilling group companies responsible, right? So in every group company you will have a separate category planner? Yes, yes, yes.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
So based on the category, you know the category, how many categories we have, but I don't know, maybe one planner may be handling two categories, maybe. Based on the category we can we can. Say we can count calculate how many planner drilling planners.

Patel, Rahul:
So we know there are around 5 categories right at high level. So so for each category will have one planner, which means that 5 into say 5 AGC is 25 planners are what we're looking for.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Approximately, yeah, yeah, it is a problem.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Maybe it may be reduced. At least this gives us a overview Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
And Titan planner is only one company only not no control.

Patel, Rahul:
Then there will be only one planner for time.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Or let's say one, one, one department. I don't know how many people are handling. At least two, maybe.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
But it's only in one company. This is on team who would be the

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sorry, go ahead, roll.

Patel, Rahul:
Time will be only on short, correct? Yeah, no, no, no.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For drilling, be the endorser? Or it goes straight to the drilling manager?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Let's say four. We'll have four different companies, right?

Patel, Rahul:
Endorser, if there is a planner?

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
you know that is something need to be decided by upper management because there is a endorser, there is a team leader in organization chart. So how to, maybe Khalid you can discuss with someone and decide on that how to, how the hierarchy should be.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is related to which area? I think this maybe you should have invited Abdul Lateef for this. Okay. I think this one we can ask drilling team, Abdul Lateef, Khalif, Ashik.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Patel, Rahul:
And then the approver when we say five, based upon five The approver for drilling and tying would be the same person, right? No, no, no. It would be a different approver for tying?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes, yes. Okay.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Tying approver may be only one because it's only in one company. Jagga, is there any chance to have an approver who were based on the shareholders in drilling? I think offshore have based on the shareholder they have different managers right different departments.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I am not sure sorry you need to check with And would the time planner also be category-based?

Patel, Rahul:
There is only one time planner.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
So you can take two.

Patel, Rahul:
One probably would be the backup. So there will be two planners and one approver.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, it would be one role with two users.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, um, moving on to the drilling manager is responsible for approval of the mind plan for drilling. So this we can take the same, uh, note.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So basically, what the team mentioned is the approval or best. Upon the AGC for drilling manager?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so five AGCs, so five upwards, drilling manager.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And Tyen manager is a different user from drilling manager, so what, one? Yeah, so yeah, one AGC for Tyen, so one user.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
GCs, which is GCs?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Drilling manager.

Patel, Rahul:
Onshore, offshore, Sorgas, Al Dhafra, and Al Yasad. Al Dhafra, Al Yasad, they have drilling? That's what we understand that for drilling, these are the five GCs in the score.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Based on the description.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
But it's sour gas. These all under sour gas, yeah? It's three companies onshore offshore sour gas, that's it. No, the current.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Yeah, let us do five because currently the Al Yashar is planned by I mean handled by offshore. Maybe in the future this is a rough estimation only. If it is plus or two or three, it's OK based on the current setup we can design the system.

Patel, Rahul:
Just the estimation only. And we'll take this as we can cross check again for this alias and all the profits.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, and keep in mind if we're going live, all of them will be only under one centralization drilling manager, huh?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
No, that is for the Inventory part here we are discussing the demand part as well.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Okay, so it's from end-user side you mean? Correct, correct. Yeah, not inventory. Okay, yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, fine.

Patel, Rahul:
So five is correct then?

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Yeah, let us say five. Maybe it may be less.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, okay.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, and then the time managers. Oh, sorry.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, time manager would be different than the drilling manager, and there's only one. So we can put one one approver.

Jaganath Doss Thangadurai (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
One time manager, not the link manager, different user.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK, OK, yes, yeah, one time manager.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'm going to go back to MRO now and move to inventory planning. So the first role is the inventory controller in terms of the level that this would sit at.

Patel, Rahul:
The inventory controller planner would be at Shared service level always. Maybe can you help here? There's no other option.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I think this is the only option.

Mohammed Sadique (ADNOC - PE&ICV):
Yes, but it will be in it also, right?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Like for example, an illness. I know I believe it should be a shared service level.

Patel, Rahul:
So how many inventory controllers access this level will take care of like will we have separate inventory controllers between say MRO chemicals and billing? How the distribution of work between different inventory controllers and planners in shared service? How many?

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Bunim, you have any idea about the organization of the inventory department? How many?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
How many inventory controllers? Mr.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Vadula will provide the exact number, but there is some organization already agreed.

Patel, Rahul:
And this plate of rolls is on metal group level?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I think it's 49, right? Yeah, I'm checking it.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Sorry, Asma, 49 across all categories, right?

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Or it's just for Amaro? Yes, yes, all categories. All. Yeah, so it may not be, Karly, it may not be 49 for Amaro. Probably be less.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Six less for drilling, because six for drilling only, so it will be 43. Sah, check please.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, I'm checking, yeah.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And then there's chemicals as well, so we might deduct that number as well.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Sorry, just a question, you mean with the managers or only the inventors? Inventors only.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
Oh, I included managers and heads. Without managers and heads, 41 would be without managers and heads.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, our role is just controller.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
OK.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there's 41 in total across all categories for controllers. That's excluding the managers.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, that method includes drilling, it includes MRO.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
As well as it includes managers, Kyle, so this number won't be just for controller.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
No, no, the 41, 41 only the inventive controllers. With the managers and team leaders, it will be 49, as Asma said.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Oh, OK, OK, sorry.

Patel, Rahul:
So do we have this further split of 41 between MRO, chemicals, and drilling? And drilling, I think, would we say That's what I heard.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Drilling will will be for pay for people. Plus OK for people plus two managers.

Patel, Rahul:
Plus head plus one manager OK. So the head would be the reviewer and manager would be the approver. Is that correct understanding?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, right right.

Patel, Rahul:
that again please head will be like so if you are a reviewer and then the manager will be approved. So you have four planners, four controllers, one lead and one manager, one head and one manager.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So for training that's for people and for chemicals.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
For chemicals, there will be four people also.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
And too many.

Patel, Rahul:
The 41 people for MRO correct or it includes chemical? No, no, it includes includes. OK, so we need to take out then 8 out of this 41 then. Yep. Yes.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Uh.

Patel, Rahul:
How this rules of 33 people would be distributed? Will it be a separate person for separate agency or material group? The responsibility of this planners would be.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, it will be. It will be distributed based on the category. There will be four categories in instrument and control. This will be one category. There will be nine people, nine inventory controllers. Yes, nine controllers. OK, and by the way, it's applicable to all two managers, one head, one team, one manager. OK, then the second section is electrical.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Would be four controllers. Yes.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Then general, will be 12 controllers.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Then mechanical, eight controllers.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
This adds up to 33, I believe.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hamad, just a question on this. So NSAP, how do you, How would you separate those? Do you specify the list of material groups for each of these categories? And that's how the controller knows what they're responsible for?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yes, exactly. Exactly what we said is right. The materials have material groups, UBGs, okay? Each specific material group is handled by a specific team.

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, okay. So a list of material groups will correspond to a category. To a category, exactly.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Asma Saleh Al Hadhrami (ADNOC - GP):
And by the way...

Bastian Osorio:
Question from my part as well.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, just one comment to add. The material groups is not 100% accurate, okay?

Bastian Osorio:
And this, the role comes in data cleansing and specifying the accurate Yeah, question from my part, we have four categories, nine controllers for electrical, four controllers for general, 12 controllers for mechanical, and eight controllers, I don't know for what, but that's one. But my question is, is there any leader in these groups? Out of the nine electrical controllers, is there one leader?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yes, as I told you, all of them have two managers, one head and one manager.

Bastian Osorio:
And the manager handles three teams. And besides defining the inventory policy for their category, What is their daily job, let's say? Create the purchase orders, receive the requests from the different AGCs. I'm trying to understand why 33 people are needed to perform this work.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
See, the main job of the 33 people is to place the purchase requisitions For the plant requirement for all other group numbers for the 1.5 million materials.

Bastian Osorio:
For the M, no, but in this case, it's just for MRO.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
It's not for chemicals or drilling, right? Yes, right. By the way, we have plenty number and a huge number of materials for non-chemical and non-drilling.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, yeah. Right material type that's what the the material I say yes yeah right not only ZRSE other types also ZIBE yeah but mainly ZRSA yeah now it's clear so just have thought that maybe we will start during the unit testing with the head, with the lead, and then we will move for the rest of the team because one training session, one like hands-on session with 33 people will not be that productive as we need to address individual doubts, but it's something that we can discuss Thank you for the information.



Patel, Rahul:
Mama, just one clarity again that 33 people you said for each category you will have one manager and one reviewer or one lead, correct?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
You know for each category there is a head and manager. However, a manager can is a major for three departments. But the head will control only one department. One section category. For example, there is a manager controlling the drilling general and mechanical together. However, for each section, for example, there is one head only.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
So two managers and three section heads and then for their Inventory controllers in three in 16 in 16.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I want six sections. Yes. Can I just ask a question?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'm sorry if I'm understood it, but if there's one head and one manager for each, so that's 246 plus 41 would be 47.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Again, the manager controls three sections. Okay, so we said six heads and two managers.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
So for MRO, we'll have six heads and two managers.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
No, not for only for MRO. It includes drilling, chemicals, tines also. So all MRO drilling, chemicals, tines, we have two managers and six sections, six teams. And in all of these teams, there are inventory controllers distributed as per the workload.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Patel, Rahul:
Is this segregation, is this documented? Will it be possible for you to share that document so that I will avoid any difference in understanding? Yeah, you can discuss with the manager, Mr.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Asma, about it. If it is not a confidential document, then you can see it here.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, so probably we don't need names, but at least only the position so that, yeah, from a rule perspective, then it helps us Make sure that we're not making any.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Incorrect assumptions.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
OK, see will approaching will be approaching the the HR to confirm if it is possible to share the document. If it's fine, I'll be sharing it with you.

Patel, Rahul:
OK. Yeah.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Thanks, but Mohammed and team If it's not possible to share the whole document, just the list with the titles would be enough.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
It's just for us to understand. By the way, yeah, by the way, what you have wrote now is almost everything, okay? Only that the difference is that there will be, for example, we said four in chemicals, two will be senior engineer, two will be engineer. This is the only difference.

Naamani, Mohamad:
Yeah, because we do not want to get into confidential info, et cetera, like job descriptions or No, it's the mapping of the process and the steps we have to the rules and individual. So we understand the sensitivity of info. We just want some clarity on the mapping.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
It is exactly what we have said. If you want, I can give you the detailed segregation. For example, you can write it down. Chemicals, there will be two senior engineers, two engineers. Not manager, senior engineer and two engineers.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
For the instrument and control.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Sorry, Mohammed, for what?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Instrument and control.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Will be having four five engineers.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
It is with the MRO. Okay. Done? Okay, I thought you were filling up.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Okay, for the electrical, two by two. Two senior, two engineers.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Not managers, engineers, yeah. And two engineers. For the drilling, you will be having two by two. Okay, for general.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
for mechanical 4x4.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
So this includes all the document, no need to approach the HR.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think we are done.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
One question with respect to the demand planning.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
The access to view will be given to all people falling in headcount, but the users are allowed to provide the, to input something and provide the feedback reviewer am I correct so that depends upon how you want us to

Patel, Rahul:
set up the view and change access for sure the respect to a person will have the editor change access but it would you you can decide who gets view access to which area which AGC at AGC level or at

Bastian Osorio:
ad-hoc level who gets the access to view things that can be defined by ad-hoc Additionally, any change also can be restricted to a set of data, to a category, for example. So if you have one inventory controller in charge of just one category, we can set and we will set something called permission filter. And in this sense, they will be able just to change inventory parameters for category, whereas for example a manager who is in charge of multiple categories of course will have access to change.

 More categories and so on.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, does that answer you or do you have any other questions?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, thank you very much.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
I got it.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so I think we're done with inventory planning role. Is there anything else you want to ask with respect to inventory planning?

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, one thing. In one of the previous discussions, we understood that there are separate role called inventory controller and inventory planner. Planner is more strategic and takes care of turnaround-related requirements. So will we, this 41 people, would we only So we'll have a separate headcount for planners.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Until now.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
No clarity about this, so we can discuss further with the manager because we have inventory controller inventory planner job doing the same people at the moment. So this. Can be discussed further.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So, Mohammed, can you help us clarify here?

Patel, Rahul:
Is this something which is going to happen in future with separate planners and controllers role?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sorry, again please.

Patel, Rahul:
In one of the conversations, we understood that there are separate planners and controllers. Controllers focus more on the tactical things on day-to-day basis, whereas planners focus more on strategic things, more related to the turnaround planning, which is more strategic in nature, is what we understood before. So is this still true?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
This is still true, but just to let you know, there will be multiple planners. From the end user side, they will start the planning process from the maintenance team, let's say. Then the start will be from there. Then the inventory control in this situation will be the inventory planner, who will plan the requirement and start replenishment process. In the middle, there will be some certain input from the material management planning, our team, who will be looking after preparing the a long-term price agreement, preparing long-term strategies to source the materials.

 So let's say they will be having three planners in a place.

Patel, Rahul:
Each one will be having different role. OK. So what you are saying is the planner's role is strategic in nature, which will look at long-term prospective from agreements and- It's high-level.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
level planning process. However, the inventory controller will be having detailed planning process.

Patel, Rahul:
So even if the actual procurement happens for say the turnaround process as well, so the purchase requisition would be raised by the inventory controller only is what you are saying. Even if it is turnaround, but the long term planning can be done by this to define who would be the, what would be the, to define the long-term agreements looking at overall demand of future. Correct? Is this understanding correct?

 Yes, correct.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
But I want to add to this something that the inventory controller, he will not be, there will be no team in the inventory controller who will be doing the planning. The inventory controller himself will be handling the planning process for the individual that he's handling, along with the replenishment process. However, for the material management planning, as Asma said, there will be two managers, right?

 However, there is a third manager, which is Asma. She will be handling the planning and performance, and under planning, I will be leading the planning team. We will be responsible for high-level planning process.

Patel, Rahul:
Okay, so long-term planning, when you say high-level, is what this team would be responsible for, and then the controllers would be looking at short term planning, say 6 months or one year. Exactly, exactly, right? So with that understanding. So so all the material level replenishment will be handled by controller only, the turnaround materials, correct? Exactly right. Yeah.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
And Rahul, if you recall in one of the meeting we provided a few categories for the strategic long term planning and that we are going to handle the planning and performance team is going to handle. That type of planning.

Patel, Rahul:
So please consider those categories also. So when you say long term planning at a category level, the job still remains the same, right? What Mohammed just explained?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Patel, Rahul:
It's just that you will have the planners focusing on specific categories, the three planners.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
In the planning team?

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, in the planning team, correct. Okay, I'm just conscious of the time because the meeting was scheduled to end at 12 o'clock. We still have some more to go through in terms of the supply planning, as well as other additional roles, such as the process champions. Is it okay to carry on, or should we reschedule this meeting? Or schedule another meeting, I mean?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
I think, you know, it is the end of the day, and the weekend is coming, so yeah, it is better to, because we are going for prior. So to reschedule and continue later on next week, Monday.

Bastian Osorio:
Yeah, there is plenty of details to be discussed, so I think it's better to schedule another hour.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Exactly.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so could I check in everyone's diaries who's a part of this team? I can check for your availability unless we all want to agree on a time now.

Patel, Rahul:
Yeah, yeah, probably if we can agree on a time now for Monday because it will be difficult to identify time for everyone at once so. Can we agree upon time for Monday?

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
schedule. OK, give me a second. Double.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Check it please.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Find with the Monday afternoon.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Yeah, I think yes. But also check the availability of our team.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Why not in the morning?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I have some cause in the morning. But if you want to continue, you can. I may not be available full time, but partially I will.

Patel, Rahul:
Before we close, probably the only thing we would like to further add to this discussion on Monday morning is that we would soon, by the end of January, plan the unit testing. So while the unit testing is internal to the project team, we would also like to involve key users from the different different areas to give them visibility in terms of how the processes are coming out. For sure, there'll be separate UAT and other processes where all the users may get involved, but we would like to have this unit testing with key users.

 So in the meantime, if you guys can have a thought about it, and on the Monday, if you can help us with the names of those key users in each area, that will help us plan those sessions with specific key users for the unit testing. OK, Inshallah.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
Now in terms of our team availability, we'll be available from 12 to 3. Just check with the other teams and schedule based on that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Better to schedule 2 to 3.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I mean, this is my advice, but then you Right now, let's get this confirmed.

Patel, Rahul:
Everyone OK with 223? We can go ahead and plan that meeting then in 223.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Almost fine. Yeah, fine.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'm sorry, is there anyone else that we need to add to this meeting? I know. I think Jaganath was saying that we need to get the EWM team, I think. The beginning of the call?

Mohamad Fakhouri (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think for the EWM team it would be separate, but at least we need to include Abdel Latif and Ashak for the release.

Mohammed N.S. Awadallah (ADNOC - GP):
So just go to 3 and check the availability of Abdel Latif and Ashak, please.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Yes, sure. One thing I Actually, we are reaching to a stage where we need to involve the end users. For example, in the demand planning, we need their feedback, their nominations. So Rahul, please arrange meeting, the basic presentation to them as per the focal point list provided so that they can be involved in upcoming meetings. And sessions.

Patel, Rahul:
Okay, the only point there which Khalid was also mentioning that there was there was supposed to be a communication between NVIDIA leadership and EWM leadership. So has that communication done so that it helps us set the context and don't further conversation.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Bhune, any idea about that conversation.

Patel, Rahul:
Can you confirm this this to separately if it is Yeah, I will check with my manager and then on Monday morning. Yeah, yeah, for sure. We'd like to initiate that conversation not only with the EWM team, also with the operations team from a chemicals perspective.

Tariq Umar Muhammad Qureshi (ADNOC - GP):
Do you also have the details of the operation teams Tariq? Yeah, we got the nominations of operation and maintenance focal points from all agencies except one which is pending.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah.

Patel, Rahul:
OK, then if we have the nomination, I think it's better if we can get this confirmation quickly. We can then plan the next steps of conversation to make sure that onboarding happens.

Kyle Campbell (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, then I will just confirm everyone's availability, but the meeting will probably be planned for Monday 2-3pm.

Patel, Rahul:
I think that concludes this call, so thank you very much. Thank you everyone. Thank you, have a nice weekend.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You too, bye bye.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you.
