So let me share the screen. We've done some home exercise with Kyle to make this exercise easier for everyone. So we've prepared kind of a matrix, yeah, where on the left-hand side we placed roles, all the roles that we have. We also mapped these roles against the process variants in demand planning, in energy and supply. This is the mapping. We'll also be going through it.\n\n Mapping is not done for the process champion part, but we can address it separately. And then we suggest to have a discussion for each of the role, for each of the group company, and think about the following things, yeah? So how exactly this role will be executing the operations for a specific group company? What frequency will be there? How many operations? What's the complexity of the operations duration?\n\n And then have a look at the estimate of how many people would be actually taking this role in the group company based on the specific structure of assets, sites, fields, rigs, wells, etc, right? And then this number, how it's going to be distributed across the org structure of the group company. So I think that exercise would be sufficient for us to understand the structure of the end users, right?\n\n And if these parameters are not group company specific, then we could just document them in a simpler way in this part of the table.

So maybe they can make these people as process champions.\n\n I don't know for sure. I cannot comment on their behalf, but this is what is looking more logical to me, because they have these inventory managers who are supposed to basically own the process, right?

So yeah, I will try to to avoid that. And the point now, now they can multiply these roles by all the AGCs. The strong recommendation is that if we can consolidate in a few ones, so because if we have, imagine that we have a responsible for each AGC, one demand manager or the demand requester for each AGC, then we always need to have the agreement of all of them need to have on all the sessions, that is a huge complication.\n\n That's why I think that we need to centralise in a few ones that can participate, that can be active, that can be on all the sessions, that have the accountability, you know, because when you have seven responsible, it's like you have no one responsible. That's my main point. I want to avoid to have these 40 people in the session or too many people in the session because When that's the case, then they are not participating.\n\n They are just inactive, doing other things, you know?

One thing, one thing. So first of all, the process champion is not one per AGC. It should be one per process, right? One for drilling, yeah, one for drilling, for chemicals and one for MRO, and we are just expanding the, sorry, we're looking, assessing the possibility of using just one role for MRO chemicals, that's fine. Regarding the planners, inventory planners, and so forth, I think, yeah, in this case, considering the amount of materials they have, it's not possible to centralize everything to just one person.\n\n Same for demand planner. But I don't believe, I mean, I would like to have not one demand planner per AGC, because then, unless it could be the case, yeah. But, yeah, I'm thinking that I'm gonna tell how it works in my experience how it's working and I will establish a parallel just for our internal understanding usually this is very similar to in terms of the process to basically a consumer goods business let's say we are selling here I don't know whatever clothes okay you have the demand is in charge of the planning in the more medium, long term of the entire demand, okay?\n\n But then the requester are the local salespeople. So they're saying, no, I'm gonna sell these to this client, this to this client. So in that sense, of course, the requester is per AGC, because they're looking at their own, let's say, field, at their own AGC, at their own area. But then, the demand planner is consolidating this whole demand from the different AGCs. So for me, demand planner and requester are not the same.\n\n The requester basically goes into the system, in this case, one or every two months, every three months, and adjusts his demand. Yeah, his demand. And then the demand planner... Requester, yeah? Yeah, the requester is just... And then the demand planner is looking at the demand every month, every month. So basically, the demand planning is consolidating the demand from different requesters, but the role of the requester is just putting the number.\n\n It's just putting a number, in this case, every three months, every five months, even every six months in a business like this, okay? And the demand requester can be per agency, and there's no problem with that. The only thing they need to how to collaborate demand. And then is the demand planner. And even just for preventive activities, for corrective activities, the system will do it. And the demand planner will do it.\n\n So in that regard, the demand planner, of course, it needs extensive training, whereas the requester needs just a couple of sessions to understand how to log into the system, how to open a planning view, and how put the number"},{"start_time":1735202415700,"end_time":1735202447828,"speaker":{"name":"Gusev, Nikita (UAE)"},"words":"and that's it request I would need a very very good guide because if he will be using it every two three five months then he will well he will forget like in four months he will forget what he was exactly doing in the system right last time so he needs to get that guide and to kind of recollect the point is that it's not too complex so Yes, we can have a very good guide for something that is simple.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735202447828,"end_time":1735202476574,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, very clear and simple. Yeah, we can create a video and that will make it. But the demand planner is the one making sure that, for example, the forecast is correctly executed, looking at the numbers.

Let's say 12 companies are there. So we have 12 set of different end users, which are only focusing on their area of responsibility. But on top of that, we have a business process owner who is actually responsible for all the agencies.

If you talk to anyone in AdNoc and say end user probably it is equivalent to demand requester what we have but I don't think they have a role where they call it demand planner and maybe one of the change we may recommend is to have someone similar to what Bastian mentioned as who communicates with different end users so that their demand can be consolidated and is more active in IBP that way we can also the impact of the change in terms of more critical role which is at a AGC level and not at individual plant or section, plant section level getting into IBP and taking key decisions.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735202571653,"end_time":1735202631657,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"But Rahul, here there is a catch that let's say demand planner in IBP currently they don't have the terms currently used, right. Now planner is consolidating the demand validating the demand and then it is handed handing over to the manager for final approval now question is will they have a single manager per agc or they have a headquarter level manager who is going to look after all the 12 agcs so that even requests are coming from individual agc then it is aggregated at the planner level they have a visibility of the entire mro operation of the adnoc group company now whenever it goes to approval, because they have a specific budget for specific AGC, right?\n\n They are not going to give approval for other AGC for the MRO if we are talking about. So again, it will disaggregate those demand going to the respective demand manager. So this part we need to discuss and clarify with them."},{"start_time":1735202631657,"end_time":1735202805903,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah, you're right, Kunal. But if you stick even to the names, for me, the requester is nothing but the maintenance is the engineer. Almost, the engineer doing the activities. And by nature, he's not a planner. Yeah, by nature, he's not a planner. He's just requesting material to perform his work, basically. And then you have the planner who's looking more on the mid-term and long-term, right? So in that regard, the demand planner slash requester For me, those are two different roles.\n\n But you're right, Kunal, in the sense of, OK, then you have the demand manager who's approving or rejecting the demand based on a budget. But is this happening at the AGC level, or is this happening at the shared services level? For me, if they're creating the shared services, it should be a shared services. Because at the end of the power, I mean, if the AGC have the power, then what's the purpose of having the shared services, right?\n\n Got it, got it. If they buy whatever they want, then what's the point or what's the role of the AGCs, sorry, of the shared services? So for me, the one call to be the one questioning the demand should be more like, demand planner, demand manager in the AGC. And of course, it doesn't have to be just one person because having 11 different AGCs, I don't know how many different locations, how many different materials, it's not a work that can be done just by one user.\n\n I think there should be at least, let's just at least two, one demand planner, per two AGCs, just forgive just a very broad number, then we have five or six demand planners. And then if per two demand planners, you have one demand manager, and you have, I don't know, two demand managers or three demand managers. And then the request can be, I don't know, five per AGC, 10 per AGC, whatever, it doesn't matter for you just have to go into the system and put a number, depending on your demand.\n\n But that is not, for me, that role is not, I'm not concerned that role of how many people have that role because, again, it's very simple. It's just putting an Excel sheet that is tied, is linked to the cloud, the amount that you think you'll need in the corresponding date."},{"start_time":1735202813552,"end_time":1735202832820,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"But the question here is at which level, demand planner, at which level, AGC level or charge services level consolidating the demand for multiple AGCs?

It's bringing a number. Okay. So this manager calls can also be a strategic person, which is what Kunal was saying, that it can be someone at AGC level who approves the entire demand of AGC so that he can work with planner. Planner essentially manages the demand and the manager essentially reviews the demand at AGC level. So it can be more strategic role. So we don't need to then have an approval for every different plant or plant section within AGC.\n\n We may end up creating, say, hundreds of users in that area. So rather than creating a manager for every requester, probably we create one demand planner which is strategic. And for that demand planner, we create a role for demand manager. And then maybe the case that we may not have this planner and manager role today at AGC level. So that's what we probably we can talk to them that we need someone like this, is this someone can take up of this ownership or do we need to define a new person?\n\n Probably that discussion can be then triggered as part of the management.

Adnogas is AGC, but within Adnoglas, there can be 10 different plants right then and within a plant there can be 10 different sections like it can be a big plant and each plant can have a different section so a requester can be a person who is who is a maintenance engineer or engineer working in a plant or a plant section managing the requirement of that specific area correct yeah yes Yes, absolutely.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735203284706,"end_time":1735203296798,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"But it's a question here that for me maybe have a misunderstanding.

Theoretically, the process does not change on how we get the demand, but yes, probably if if this is how if we can communicate this change and soften the impact of number of users who are critical to us in terms of IVP, then, yeah, probably we may need to add a swim lane for requester who is essentially only providing simple input in terms of number.

So now we understand that there are 11 AGCs. We understand that the end users are multiple in nature based upon plant and plant section.

But then this demand requester is something which a demand planner is something which are proposing.\n\n Now, this proposal, either this can be someone from the business, AGC, managing the entire demand, because the demand planner and the manager who's approving the demand is the owner of the budget of that AGC, right? So it cannot, can or cannot be a shared service. So probably we'll need your help to take this change request so that AdLoc can decide whether they want to move this role as part of centralized shared service, or they want to create a role within AGC who is responsible for managing the demand of all the plants within AGC, and then the manager within AGC who is owner of the budget of that AGC can approve that, okay, for a given AGC, for FY25, the overall procurement budget or overall planning budget is, say, 10 million, then whatever plan, demand is created, whether it is in alignment with that 10 million plan or not.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735203599294,"end_time":1735203633456,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"I'm just putting some numbers here. Rahul, a question. Yeah, a question, Rahul. Because usually the role of the demand planner is questioning a little bit the demand put by the requester. Because the requester requests whatever they believe in, whatever they want. They're very wishful thinking sometimes. So who is questioning the number of the requester here if the demand planning is also from the agency?\n\n Who's saying no, that's way too much?

Who's questioning the number? Because maybe I have a misunderstanding again, I'm not an expert in how they're organized. If they're part of the same agencies, I believe, but I could be wrong again, that if there are questions, say a hundred that they won't plan, we'll say, okay, a hundred. And they don't have a counterpart saying, is this number not right?\n\n This is this number make sense based on this on the, on the consumption history, based on the, and everything who's basically looking at the numbers on a more trend side and saying, no, look, this doesn't make any sense.

All three are from the Inventory Controller and Excellence team. It means Demand Planner as well as Inventory Controller is a very thin role to be done by the same person.\n\n Inventory Controller, we are saying Demand Planner. As per the IPP, we have three different modules. Are treating this as the same thing.
