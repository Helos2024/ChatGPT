And we have all the discussion that I mean, here I have also additional confusion, which Bignesh said that they plan, or this is what I understood, they plan just on a generic code, but some other people mentioned that no, they plan on generic codes, but also a vendor's code.\n\n And they discussed a little bit, but I didn't get the final definition so what's your I understand that you have um rahul uh you you have the understanding that they're planning on both generic code and vendors code and the"},{"start_time":1732174768247,"end_time":1732174933193,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"bombs have those two two type of codes right agreed so one of the open point for today's discussion is to have this clear definition of uh what different types of form because what we understood is if you remember there are five material categories. So let's identify what are those five metal categories and every metal category may have a bomb. Also, and how this metal categories are. Linked to the completion codes and also in the completion code.\n\n If you remember in the last discussion with the end users, they say that they have something called completion code and then they have something called additional completion code. Code are kind of optional which means if the additional completion codes are selected during well planning then the bill of metal the components of the additional completion code should also get included which means that I see that we do not have the complete bill of metal identified to identify all the materials which are which will be required for planning a given well.\n\n So as part of today's discussion I'm trying to get this specific clarity that how we can like get this confirmation on like what are different completion codes, how they are linked to each other, how they are linked to different material categories and then how Vignesh or SAP will use this information to define BOM so that it can be aligned with IBP. This is one of the primary point of discussion today so that one we are able to define well so first two points are first the second point is how we define wealth and the third point this form is how we get the all the components of the wealth.\n\n Does that make sense? Yeah, so this is still an open. So based upon my discussion, what Vignesh is trying to do is define a single bill of material which has the attributes. The bill of material will have like well type, well header, like welcome whatever segmentation we are using for well including the completion code the bill of material will have this attribute which means if we can read this attribute as a bill of metal we can identify which bill of metal to be used for a specific well type so it's the same combination which defines the well the same combination information will be available on bill of metal header for us to select the correct header.\n\n Okay but then we will clarify this in today's discussion with Abdul Latif and others."},{"start_time":1732174933193,"end_time":1732174990057,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah and then well I think the rest of the of the master data is pretty straightforward once we have these definitions because then we have location product which comes from S4HANA for the combination of drilling materials and it's different, there are different locations. Source location also from S4HANA, one conversion, unit of measure and location which has to be, this is the another one that we need to define.\n\n At which level are we planning? At plant? At storage location? And finally, are we planning to integrate vendors? And if that's the case, how?"},{"start_time":1732174990057,"end_time":1732175041028,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Yeah, so this is an important definition which we need to define. What are the physical locations which are getting served? And offshore like while we understand offshore is like somewhere in the sea and onshore is somewhere on the land and then so this this flow of material from vendor like from vendor location to VMI location to ad-hoc location to end consumption location we need to capture those location and then identify what this locations mean in S4HANA whether it is a storage location, whether it's a plant, all those are different so that we have a clear like flow, clear perspective of how the materials are flowing so that we can map in SVARANA, IVP, correct?\n\n"},{"start_time":1732175041028,"end_time":1732175052575,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"Now let's change our topic regarding the storage location.

Now from IBP we don't care at a storage location level, but SAP will always consume of a specific storage location. Without storage location you cannot consume a stock in SAP."},{"start_time":1732175075291,"end_time":1732175087818,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"So that's the lowest level where the stock resides.

And in a way it is linked to the entire flow of data, right? Because there is also one thing probably they are doing is at company level. They are doing planning at onshore versus offshore. And probably they are not distributing inventory at a big level to start with. So the entire planning for all the all the drills, all the wells, they're planning at a single location. And when they're goods issuing it, they're issuing to the respective, say, cost center of the respective wells.\n\n So that is something we need to understand so that we clear, because for sure in SAP, the stock has to be at storage location level. But if it is a vendor stock, which means it's not in S4 HANA. That's why they're putting the stock at company code level, just for the inference that whether it is the stock onshore or offshore to associate with the respective companies but then we need to then align that okay if it is at company code level then how we utilize this stock in IBP for respective well planning that differentiation we need to identify.\n\n So that's where in today's discussion these are three or four major points which we need to clarify one is the planning from like how the planning happens from different planning tools and then what kind of materials they are used to flow this information that's one piece of information second is the bill of material information how we can identify the right materials and material codes and the bill of materials including the one is to define the well plan second once you have the well plan how to identify the correct material codes with the right completion codes.\n\n And third is this piece where once you have the plan, once you know material, then how the material comes from vendor to the point of consumption so that we can map all different locations toward location plants in the planning process. And once we have this clarity, probably then most of our answers will be questions would be answered. And then the next step would be then take this information and talk to technical team for mapping all the data sources.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732175365970,"end_time":1732175381625,"speaker":{"name":"Arun Singh"},"words":"So add one more column here to talk about the filter.
