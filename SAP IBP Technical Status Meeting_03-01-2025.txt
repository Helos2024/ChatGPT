Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Morning, Hector.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Morning Nishant morning Hector.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
I am in the Another that firewall. Requirement is no, it's going to a different loophole. I mean, see the issue is the laptops that the team carrying the video in fact has got dynamic IP addressing so every time they log in it generates a new IP.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
These are ad-hoc devices right?

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Exactly so I assume so.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
You can give the device name also that will also help.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
But I checked with our friend So he said that some range has to be given. Now, range, when I checked, the first two part, they said that's going to be huge. So you guys have to narrow it down further. And I don't know. I think I'll have to get back to Khalid or somebody and figure out how they've done in any previous similar cases.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
How did it get approved? Yeah, so let's do one thing, Nishant. Can ask for a separate call the network team and tell them guys like you know this is something you have to give us an input based on it.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
We will create a ticket. Yeah, so I've asked. I had a call with Sajid yesterday, so I told him he said to send him a mail. So I I had sent him an email. I think you're not there in loop.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'll just loop you in as well, OK?

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
Good morning Nishant. Good morning.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Morning.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Hi Kunal. Yeah, hi.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Nishant, I spoke to Sagar on this. So till the time our issue is resolved, we can get into a call with you to just start this integration activity on Borut side.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
We could do that. That's not a problem. So yeah, so I think I marked you. You're there in the mail. I sent a mail to Sajid yesterday. I've been trying to get in touch with him since morning, but he's not. I think he's very busy. And also, I think we'll have to check with Khalid. Khalid is not there. But somebody, how they've done similar, how they've given access in similar projects earlier.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
See, this range, Nishant, see these are, if it is borrowed, for example, if it's VDI, then probably if you reach out to the network team, they will know exactly what is the range or subnet range, whatever that should be given. This is one. And if they are from different locations. That's when you know I don't have to have you tried asking thoughts. I called he was off yesterday. He picked up.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
He said that he doesn't look into firewall anymore, but then again I was trying to get in touch with other people who are responsible for VDI, but all of them seem to be off this week.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
Yusuf.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
If you have any vasta, pull them in because I think this is pending for a while now.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
OK, I would say this.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah, just see if you can. I tried. I tried reaching out somebody who usually responded Or if you know Kamal Sreedharan or Read.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Kamal Sreedharan.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
I would say let's not pull them in this call because yeah, I'm just sending the messages here.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
The Kaiser is on leave.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
Yeah, everybody's sick. Fine, Kunal.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Apart from that, is there anything else?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, I think that is all and Nishant, us on this integration part the same which we have done for the gurus one year it is still pending and we have a service user but we don't have a password for that and they are asking us to connect with the basis team. This is for the AdNoc right?

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah AdNoc 1 ERP.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
AdNoc 1 ERP means we will have the advisor or there is an email ID right like SAP infrastructure or SAP security at AdNoc Sagar already touch base with them, but they won't be able to share the password.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
They said we need to connect with the basis team of AdNoc.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Prem is available. Prem Prabhakar. I think we'll have to ask Sajith Ananda for this one also.

Anandha Krishnan (Borouge):
See what I did with Ronaldo is also in the screen sharing session.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I just, you know, keyed in the Correct, I requested for the same only, like I already sent email to Infra team and said we can connect and I can share my screen, you guys can pass the password but I

Mohammed Mannan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
haven't received any reply. Check with Sajid, he will be able to assign someone to punch in the password.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think Sajid is the backup for the Kaiser.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So Sagar, just get in touch with Sajid Kumar. Maybe he can help us on this to set up the SAP connection with one ERP.

Mohammed Mannan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, I will do that. Do you have the request number for this? Sorry? Do you have the request number for this service user? Data under which this service user was created? No, I just have a service user ID like I received yesterday from Rahul. From Rahul, okay. They might because the basis team will ask you under which request this was created. Kunal, do you have any idea on that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no Sagar.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because Rahul is aligned with Khan on it so I don't have visibility on the service request. Maybe we can check the training.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because the ID is already created I just need password and that also means not password exactly the screen share they just have to pass so I will check like if they request for us this request ID then I would again go back and check the ground. And Nishant I have one So, for the Burush, I mean for AdNoc we had installed the IBP add-ons earlier. So, I am not sure about the Burush.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So, you have any idea like that was already installed or that yet to be installed?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
What was the question again, Sagar? Yeah, IBP add-ons basically we have to install in the S4 HANA system. Yeah, on the sandbox it's been installed. For Buruj also?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah, right.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then we just have to extract, basically add a data into that and extract. Okay, so Nishant, I will check with Reynaldo, mostly he said like he will be available in his afternoon. I'm not sure how late it will be for you, but you have time when we can connect. And you like you can share screen because we don't have access to more.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yes, OK, can we do? Hours afternoon I can do that. Just let me know what time you wanted. That fine. So I can repeat. On Monday I can spend 2 to 3 hours so I will get you in my task accordingly. Just speak to him and come back to me, maybe in the afternoon. I can sit with him, share my screen for a couple of hours if he wants.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, I will be there. I think you are anyway, right? So he will be. I'm not sure he will be available, but yeah, I will be available and I can guide you can do that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you. Yeah, by chance, is it feasible for you to connect today afternoon? If feasible for you. We know all are having a back to back schedule meetings. So Friday little bit. At least just to set up what we can complete if possible for you. Can we do it UAE time around?

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
3 to 4 is fine with me. 3 to 4 OK. Yeah, yeah.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you check with Reynaldo so that 3 to 4 at least we can start with the Buruj part. And once we are done with the service user of one year then we will take it forward for the next week because otherwise we are we are already running in a delay so I think let us utilize this time whatever we can because now oss also we have raised but now because of the unavailability of the service as user id we are unable to respond to the sap yeah uh michelle tiling three I will uh send you the

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
invite for three Yeah, sure.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, thanks.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thanks Nishat for your time. So I think that is all from our side. So I think let us then catch up on at 3 o'clock and then we can take it forward for the setup part as at least for the Buruj. And Sagar also check with Sajid for this two point if we are able to resolve that issue by today.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):

And I don't know whether you guys know he passed away yesterday morning. And my heart bleeds when I say this, that I really miss him. Especially, since 2018, I've worked with him a lot.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
