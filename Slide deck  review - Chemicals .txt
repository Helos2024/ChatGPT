Be an input exactly to five.\n\n Then we analyze the forecast for the man-plant. If there's any adjustment, plan and needs to do, they'll do it.

So the steps of 1, 2, 8 are done by inventory because we are looking at only historical consumption and that historical consumption is driving forecast.

One is you gather the demand on historic consumption. And then the other one is just an input that, OK, this is what I need. There's no statistical forecast.

Why is that? Because maybe the inventory planner is taking the production input as an input to make the final decision of what is going to be the final number. So here it looked like okay they have on the inventory planning has a number and they they don't see the demand at uh on until the review of the consolidated demand so this is like it seems to a little too late but but I get the point there I mean for me what is important to highlight is the The inventory plan sees the statistical forecast, sees the production input, and then defines the final number.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729080891167,"end_time":1729080948586,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So the idea of putting it here was that forecast is an independent step, like from the historical until you confirm the forecast, like whatever steps after the forecast are independent, and then the manual demand is a separate input now only at the point when at step where you have the consolidated view where you you know what is my forecast and you know what is my demand we can move the box of step 9 like much before but then it will connect to step 10 only right that's what I feel do you think we can connect it to like step 6 when we are analyzing demand because if that's the case then we are looking at the consolidated demand one from forecast and other from, so there are two key figures, right?\n\n One will be the forecast and other would be the manual input. So this is, so when he's analyzing at step six, will he analyze the manual demand as well as per you?"},{"start_time":1729080951327,"end_time":1729080951547,"speaker":{"name":"bastian.osorio@go-scm.com"},"words":"Yes."},{"start_time":1729080960090,"end_time":1729080973483,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1"},"words":"And what will happen to the forecast?

In this case, production, they can have their own input and they can put it and then is about to which one is going to be the main input for because we know inventory has the final word right so yeah so the question is maybe the production is going to serve just as an input it's not going to play any role in the actual calculation or maybe it does maybe if there is a an input for production then that input will replace the statistical forecast.\n\n And just in case there is no input from production, then we take the statistical forecast. And then whether you have a statistical forecast or production input, then the inventory planner can also make an adjustment. But the thing is that the final word is up to the inventory planner, and this is happening for me here in 0.7 and after that you're receiving the input so it's like they're doing the final that they're making the final decision then after that they're receiving the input so this is okay so let's let's so step six is analyze forecast and at this step we will get the input from manual demand from chemical.\n\n"},{"start_time":1729081076631,"end_time":1729081081394,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (Patel, Rahul) - Speaker 1"},"words":"So then what happens at step 7 then?

Let us correct the rest of the flow. Then it is fine, it is already done. Because then there is no review of It is already consolidated. But he's already reviewed it before. Yeah, that's what the 6, 7, 8 is kind of review only. You don't need step 10. You don't need step 10.

Yes. No, you're not saying adjustment of forecast adjustment. You just use the word adjustment because here you are trying to like you have both the inputs, right? So essentially you are trying to do adjustment and define which the correct input so that there's a separate key figure which essentially is uh but not we're not just saying which one is correct but it might be based on historical consumption as well as the manual input you might increase yeah so that's because it's still an adjustment so you are not adjusting the forecast forecast is a key figure demand is a key figure now manual input adjustment can be an input now if that input adjustment Adjustment is there, it's overrides.\n\n Yeah, you're right, it's not the word.
