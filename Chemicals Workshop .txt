Even Hector, for slow movers, one every three years is a green area, I will put neutral. And this one is bad in the system. It's not that bad, it's just it's harder to get the results that they want.\n\n Okay, but the thing, there is an underlying assumption here, and this is what we we want help for you guys is the service level. For us, it's a given and it's 98%. Okay. But we wanted to help you in defining what should be the right level to use. Because, again, as I said, based on the I think this is way more business centric. So for us, again, from the system perspective, it's just, it's up to the business to say, what is the service level?\n\n So of course, in AVP, it can be calculated based on certain rules, again, defined by the by the business but yeah I don't know what was your thought?"},{"start_time":1729600910218,"end_time":1729600945939,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"Basian service level is basically calculated there is a provision available in inventory see they have a static service level yeah no go ahead go ahead finish then I'll know what I'm saying is see based on Murugan's last point they have a static service which they are currently maintaining the masters as well as they also looking for a system driven service level let's say I would like to go from 98 to 99 percent so what should be my ideal"},{"start_time":1729600945939,"end_time":1729601029239,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"lead time as well as the inventory policy which I need to consider for the planning yeah so my question is in line with what Kunal said is this you want as input or this will be derived from the system and what I am understanding is it should be derived by the system as well as user can provide this an input and that can be a simulation for them like if the service level changes and what is the impact of it because I liked what we did yesterday where you like showed us that okay similar to what they are doing today if there is no safety stock there is no reorder point but if they have just one thing assuming that one store is a safety stock, then it will lead to, say, 99.9% of service.\n\n That's an outcome of the activity based upon this information. So can we kind of correlate what we are trying to do with respect to what they would understand and say that, OK, if you have this categorization of fast mover, medium mover, and slow mover, and then based upon this categorization, what Poisson model will suggest as a required inventory and with that required inventory what kind of service level can be achieved?\n\n"},{"start_time":1729601029239,"end_time":1729601063659,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"For me it works the other way around.

I know, I know."},{"start_time":1729601063659,"end_time":1729601322750,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"We have like three laptops. I wanted to make sure. Okay, so the point is that the service level for choice and input that you can use the system to analyze what is the impact if you want to change the service level from 95 to 98, something like that is certainly possible, but it's always an input. But then you can iterate. You can see the numbers that you're getting with different numbers of service level, but It's not that the system is going to give you as an output the service level.\n\n That needs to be clear. So what the system proposes, you know that we have all these formulas that here we are going to use the Poisson that I was explaining yesterday. And one of the very big inputs of Poisson formula is the service level. It's on a slide that we didn't get the opportunity to explain. But we wanted to show something like this. Can I borrow the screen again? Yeah, sure. Okay. So basically, a service level is some definition that we need to take, and it's very correlated to the risk that a stockout can have on the demand or on the operation, sorry.\n\n So our initial thought and what SAP proposes are the structure. Is let's use some segmentation and combination to create kind of a decision tree to say, okay, these are the most critical ones, and this is level two, level three, and so on. Kind of similar to what Muruan wanted to do yesterday with that matrix. So the initial thought for us was, okay, these are the most important ones. Vital is something that is going to impact operations, so they should have the higher service level and consequence the higher safety stock because we need to have a stock for them.\n\n Right? That's initial shock. Yesterday we realized that even for some vitals they are putting like minimum stock levels. So now we understand that the most important one is the frequency one. So even if you have a vital segmentation, the frequency is the hierarchical one because if you are very, very low frequency, like medium and slow, either way you will have minimum stock, right? And so on. They have different segmentation.\n\n This was ABC based on the total value. You multiply the volume by price, you get the total value. And we can order from A, the most important ones, to see the less valuable. Then they have the HTML, the unitary cost. Of price. I think that they were discussing this yesterday when they were saying like over 50,000 dirham is related to this. And then all the less important segmentation. This is what I wanted to show yesterday.\n\n I wanted to show them this segmentation matrix. This is what we need to try to have at least a first iteration right now. Is that for the vitals they were saying this is the score one, the most critical one. If it is essential, we need to check the other segmentation. Fast, medium, slow, and based on that, we can assign different scores. But that was the idea. The vital was critical, fast moving, and A was critical.\n\n Then medium, B or C, slow moving, B or C were less critical. And desirable and non-moving, they don't even have safety stock. They are the lower priority. But I think that this is too soft. For what they are asking. They are asking something much more, how to say, strict. And this is what we need to try to come up between us based on yesterday's discussion. I don't know if this is making sense to you guys.\n\n Is it understandable on your side, Kunal, Yeah, yeah, Hector, definitely it makes sense."},{"start_time":1729601322750,"end_time":1729601334601,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"And this is which Murugan was looking for.

That is something we can they will understand that system will propose RISC-Core. And then based on the RISC-Core, we can then derive, categorize the material. And based upon that RISC-Core categorization, we can define whether reorder points needs to be set or not, at what RISC-Core we start setting reorder point, and at what RISC-Core we start setting the safety stock and reorder point.\n\n So that way, then we can help them arrive to this decision of segmenting the material.

We need to work in the system to show them.\n\n And in this part, while I can put like just neutral, saying that all these cases will be calculated automatically by the system and this one, although it can be calculated automatically by the system, it will require maybe more attention. That's one but we need to put this into the system and show these examples, okay? That's what we'll take most of our day. So I don't know if KPMG can take the explanation to derive the service level, because we can have the conversation, it can be endless, but we have more or less a common understanding.\n\n So is it possible, Rahul, you and the guys come up with a couple of slides by tomorrow, And for our part, we show the system for all these different cases, which we believe is the most relevant segmentation."},{"start_time":1729601700383,"end_time":1729601729665,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Can we go back to the PPT which Hector was presenting?

And ABC is in terms of value.\n\n This is exactly what they are doing today, right?

We are able to segment the materials and based upon the segmentation, we're able to define what happens to the material in IPP. Now, what is the definition of risk score and what is the definition of target level?\n\n This can be an arbitrary data, which is fine, which we can review in the meeting and then ask that as an input that you need to tell us what is the service level you are expecting for those targeted risk scores. So in a way we say that if risk score is 1 and the target level is 99 and for that material if it is in what we call critical material for them and they don't and from an ABC perspective or it's a high value atom so we can replace ABC by HSC whatever high low h ml whatever classification we are doing so that we can then come up with this matrix definition in the meeting and agree to this definition that what is the what are the criterias what is the matrix and based upon the matrix uh this is what you want to consider in ibp uh with supply planning this is what you don't want to consider in ibp which means the reorder point is zero safety stock is zero and then this goes into SAP as reorder point planning.\n\n So I think this slide will serve the purpose unless anyone has any other thought or if anyone has any question."},{"start_time":1729601913295,"end_time":1729601927957,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"Rahul one point here see ABC consumption part anyway we have covered but on the other day which we are discussing they are also looking for a quantity of consumption as well as frequency of consumption as a segmentation so that"},{"start_time":1729601927957,"end_time":1729602010472,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"is also one of the deciding factors to arrive at the so say the frequency of consumption is fmsn right so frequency of consumption is taken by fmsn fast moving is based upon how many quantity consumed in the time frame that's the already segmentation now only thing which we need to do is replace abc which uh high value low value medium value hml whatever it is so if we replace that with hml then we we now have the value of the uh material.\n\n We now have the frequency of the material and we have now the variability of VED of the material. So these three parameters in combination can help us identify the risk score and for a risk score we can identify what are the next steps happening in IBP and then target service level will be an input. So the only thing I'm missing that if target service level is to be provided input or not or with this information we can simply go ahead and plan like because in this case the way they have defined that zero ROP, zero safety stock, and just one material in inventory can lead to 100% service level, right?\n\n Because it's not getting consumed in two, three, four years period of time.

So we need to just throw this idea to them so that they can able to understand their business and come out with the different segmentation and classification part which we are looking for."},{"start_time":1729602230990,"end_time":1729602273823,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Yeah, and I don't want to have, I want to have that discussion tomorrow so that we can discuss review and try to even put this some structure to this since this is what we'll use this is how we'll use and then probably Sebastian's help would be required to defining the formulas because they are also interested in formulas that how these three will be linked together to define the risk score like is this just a plain matrix and then based on the risk score we define the target service level And based on the target service level, we use the algorithm from portion to determine the values.\n\n We need to be able to show this relationship."},{"start_time":1729602273823,"end_time":1729602276345,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"We already have that in this."},{"start_time":1729602276345,"end_time":1729602291061,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"We have here how to select them all. This is just related to select the proper service level, because a higher service level will receive a higher period of points with a lower service level."},{"start_time":1729602291477,"end_time":1729602347232,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"agreed so we need to able to show this journey that this is the metrics based upon the metrics you get risk score based upon the risk score you put the service level based upon service level uh you you run the poison algorithm and you get an outcome now that outcome in terms of rop and safety stock should match their expectation so that if we are able to demonstrate that okay risk score is one service level is 99 and for the service level the Poison algorithm is able to give reorder point as zero, safety stock as zero, and then you just need one inventory to cover, then that completes the journey for them, which means they can rely on this definition of service score and this definition of service level to come to the same outcome which they are doing manually.\n\n Am I making sense?"},{"start_time":1729602347240,"end_time":1729602380858,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"we can do is to establish discussion but let's try to not get into that discussion again like yesterday because otherwise we are going to have the two hours and we are not going to decide. Maybe we can push on their side the definition if we set the rules clear what we are trying to achieve with the risk score and the service level and trying to reproduce all the scenarios they want. I think that they can come up with the definition by themselves if we are not able to get like in 15 minutes, then I think that is a homework.\n\n Instead of a 40 seconds."},{"start_time":1729602380858,"end_time":1729602479759,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"But then we can proceed with homework. But then we should be able to demonstrate both in IPP and in discussion that, OK, this is the journey. This is the segmentation. Based on segmentation, this is the risk score. Based on risk score, this is the service level. And based on service level, this is how IBP will calculate value for you. And to be able to demonstrate it in IVP so that they would understand how it is going to impact their inventory level definition, and then provide this input to us separately.\n\n Does that make sense? Yeah, OK. In that case, then I don't think we need to do anything about the slides. At the same time, I don't think from a process perspective, we will be able add a lot of value to this this slide with definition uh with slide we just you just need to clean up this slide to make the value in terms of like uh more numerical in nature like rather than a b b c just put something like more than 50 000 50 000 to 40 000 40 000 to 30 000 just an uh just an sample so that it can be discussed in the meeting or you can put hml as uh Yeah, it would be interesting that we...\n\n We use HTML? Yeah, let's use HTML. Let's propose to use HTML rather than a number so that it is more consistent with the already segmentation we have. And we say that HTML, and then based upon this, we ask them this input."},{"start_time":1729602479759,"end_time":1729602486916,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Okay, Hector, we need to leave because we need to prepare the demo, otherwise we won't have enough time."},{"start_time":1729602489057,"end_time":1729602489412,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Yes."},{"start_time":1729602489766,"end_time":1729602507502,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"So I think we are aligned.
