I think on the call, we need to explain that, yes, this is how it works, but it needs learning also. It cannot just immediately guess and come up with accurate results, if that's the right, I think one of your, when you said pros and cons or advantages advantage was about this.\n\n So rather than say no it's not possible, we'll tell them what is possible and how it can improve with time through them being more involved and fine-tuning.

We don't have algorithms for that. The approach of IVP for that is to do manual identification of reference materials.

Will end up having this one. So just to set context to everyone, Essentially, why we are having this call? Clearly identify roles and responsibilities. So in today's environment, maintenance team and users are responsible for creating the first reservations, making sure the maintenance act is getting completed. Now, what we understand, they are not part of any planning process.\n\n Essentially, inventory management team is responsible for the planning process. With IBP, so today I know there is nothing called demand forecast because most of the planning is either reorder planning or MRP or metal reservation based planning, which means there is nothing called forecasting. With IBP we are trying to bring in this proactive approach of forecasting the requirement so that the inventory and supply processes can depend upon this forecast.\n\n So with this new approach of IBP, we want to make sure that AdNoc is aware of the roles and responsibilities of whoever is planning. Now, in this case of MRO, the understanding is the demand would be the ownership of the maintenance people, the EMPO. And then they would confirm the demand so that inventory can work on inventory processes. So to have this change management process smoothly executed, we are having this meeting where we can explain to Vignesh and Khalid what we expect like what are the activities are expected from a demand perspective by an end user so that they can help us like draft in such a way that this can be taken up with Rajesh and I forgot his name so essentially these are the maintenance process owners and then they can then take this conversation up with the end users.\n\n So with this context let's start with this discussion and Vignesh feel free to ask any questions or any clarifying doubts if you have any questions and guide us if this is something we can take up with next level."},{"start_time":1732176700943,"end_time":1732176794314,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Yeah so basically we will start from top bottom. We will start defining the different roles and then we will drill down a little bit to the more specific part which is related to what Rahul was mentioning about who's going to do what in the system. Usually, and this is in our experience, we need to be very very minimalistic, very simple, very lean into creating the roles because having like a hundred different roles make things complicated.\n\n So we start with leading business roles, which basically then we can use as a template to the creation of then more, more specific roles. So we will have, we're proposing here seven different roles. The administrator, which has access to do anything in the system, basically. And when I say anything, I mean, first of all, user management. User management is basically creating users in the system and also assign business role.\n\n So maybe, I don't know, Rahul has a role, the administrator can change role. It's the only user, it's the only business role I can do that. Okay, then we have."},{"start_time":1732176794314,"end_time":1732176811456,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"Sorry to interrupt you, but in the interest of time that we have 45 minutes, so let's briefly go through this and then focus on the demand planner which is more related to the context of our meeting today which is"},{"start_time":1732176811874,"end_time":1732176815219,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Demand planning. Is that okay? Yeah. Thank you."},{"start_time":1732176815465,"end_time":1732176892978,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"Then we have the configuration, which of course the administrator can do, but also the configuration expert. These roles are basically reserved for consultants and IT experts. Then we have data visibility, and that is something that we can discuss as initial purpose we're saying in terms of database ability all the roles will be able to see everything that doesn't mean they can change they can change it of course but they can see all the data in the system if this is not if this is doesn't fit your requirement of course it can be changed and that also leads us to the viewer role there's a a role that is called viewer that can be used for, for example, financial planners or for financial people that can want to have a look at the plant, at the different plants in ADP so they can take a look at everything but they cannot change a thing basically.\n\n Okay."},{"start_time":1732176892978,"end_time":1732176909727,"speaker":{"name":"Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Can this be used by management? Can this role be used by the management? View the data who may be directly not working on the tool itself, but maybe they want to see the reports."},{"start_time":1732176909727,"end_time":1732177287512,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"That's right. Then we have data editability, so basically who's going to be able to change data. Here we have it and here the only, well of course, the administration, configuration expert and the process champion can change data. And here we can maybe also put this one here. Maybe the process champion can change just some data. We will define that. But the daemon plan, inventory plan, and supply pattern can change data, but with some restriction.\n\n The same with editable key figures. They can change just a few key figures. Here the process champion can change all the editable key figures. It's not they can change anything. They can only change the editable key figure. Let me give you an example. Actual consumption. Actual consumption comes from S4HANA. That's why it is not editable. It's just a data input and cannot be changed. Then forecast, for example, forecast input, of course, that can be changed.\n\n That requires users' input, so that can be changed. But following the example of the demand planning, and we will review this in more detail. Maybe the demand planner will be, let's say, assigned per AGC. So he can change the forecast just per his AGC. But we will review this in full detail in the next tab. Then template creation. Each one of the process of each one of the steps in the business process needs to have its own template.\n\n Then this template can be tailored, it can be saved as a favorite for any user. But for a template creation, the only ones that can do that are the administrator, the configuration expert, and the process champion. So basically here, let's say the configuration expert, the consultants with the process champion, I don't know, for demand planning, three, I'm just giving an example, three templates, which will serve the purpose of completing all the demand planning process.\n\n Okay, so they are the only ones that can do that. The viewer, of course, the demand planning, inventory planning, and supply planning cannot change, cannot create templates. They can save their own favorites, they can adjust it, for themselves, not for the rest of the company. And finally, the job run. Of course, we will run statistical forecast. We will run a copy operator that symbolize the approval of certain data.\n\n We will run the inventory job for the calculation of the inventory policy. And finally, we will run SNOP MR operators SNOP operators, sorry, for the generation of purchase orders and PRs and STRs. This can be done only by Process Champion, okay? Of course, this is our initial proposal, then we can iterate and fine-tune based on requirement. Maybe we will allow some users to run certain jobs, but that is something that needs to Okay, this is the very high level initial build.\n\n But of course, we can use these templates to then create more roles that have more specific restrictions. So we will take a look at that here. Okay, so these are all the, in a very, I did this just in a very, because we haven't finished the configuration, so we don't have all the GIF that are needed, but this is in a very simple, simplistic way. So, we have the key figures that need input from users.\n\n So, first of all, the forecast for corrective maintenance, the plan adjustment for preventive maintenance, the forecast input for chemicals, the well plan adjustment, the risk level, adjusted reorder point, modeling cost, we will take a look at that later, and the adjusted transport receipt. Okay, so the question is, who can change what? So of course, okay, the process champion can change everything.\n\n Basically, he can give an input in any of these key figures. But if we go to the demand planner MRO, he can only change because he's assigned to MRO, he can only change the forecast input for corrective maintenance and the plan adjustment for preventive maintenance. It can happen that a user have more than one role. So let's say a user is charged. I don't know if that's the case, but let's say it happens, has a role of demand planner and also demand planner chemicals.\n\n In that case, he will be also, with these two, he also will be able to change the forecast input for chemicals. And finally, not finally, but next, we have the demand planner for drilling. And he can only change the well plan adjustment. And this is, of course, the other way around, too, meaning that if you are demand planner for drilling, you cannot change the forecast input for corrective maintenance.\n\n And then inventory planner, of course, he can change the service level. The Adjust Reorder Point. And finally, the Supply Planner, he can change the Adjust Reorder Point, Modeling Cost, and Adjustment Transport Supply, which is basically Adjust PRs and STRs. Is there any doubt at this point? Because we will jump into the next part, which is the Permission Filter."},{"start_time":1732177287512,"end_time":1732177292052,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"No, there is no doubt.

So starting from, for example, daemon-planner-mro, we can create them. In this case, I put 11 different AGCs.

We can only keep it for manual reservation because there is no point of putting reservation again because work order creates reservation automatically, right?\n\n So if we are showing consumption then we don't need to show a model reservation which is triggered by the work order, but just show the model reservation which is just manually created that we there is no duplication of information"},{"start_time":1732177876834,"end_time":1732177881411,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Or data.

I'm also thinking in that way. Whatever you're saying is true when it comes to, you know, sales module. Maybe you will have a sales supervisor who does that. But for me, OK, anyway we will. We will, but I understood what what is the role of this process process champion. We can discuss this in detail later, but then yeah, that's the gist of the role. Fine, let's go to the next.\n\n Now, based on the statistical forecast, what is the 3 and 5? You just tried to put 5 in 2027, it did not allow you to exceed the forecast, correct?"},{"start_time":1732178270857,"end_time":1732178521271,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"We have a window of two weeks within every month that allows collaboration. If we are outside of that week, the system won't allow collaboration. Why is that? Because again, we need to follow the step-by-step of the process. If the forecast hasn't been generated or if we're in the supply phase, you cannot change the forecast. Because the inventory, the safety stock, the reorder point will be determined based on the forecast.\n\n So if we are already in the inventory part, you cannot change the forecast. I mean a planner. But we think so, but let's let's keep with the step by step. The forecast was generated and now users are allowed to make changes to the forecast. So here we have two key figures. The planners input and the final. So the logic here is pretty simple. Or the planner collaborates, or he doesn't collaborate. As simple as that.\n\n If he doesn't collaborate, then the final forecast will be the statistical forecast. Okay? If he collaborates, then the system will take as default his collaboration. What is the purpose of this? That the ownership of the forecast belongs to Okay, so no one can say, oh, I didn't put this number. No, I mean, you saw the forecast and you were able to change it if you like it, right? If you don't, we assume you, because there's nothing, I mean, we cannot assume anything, nothing more than the forecast.\n\n Okay, so once these two weeks are finished, we will take snapshots of these tricky figures. So each month we will have photos of what was the collaboration of the scientific forecast, of the planners input and the final. So what will allow this to us is basically noise in the background. So what will allow this to work is basically track, measure the accuracy of all the different collaborations, right?\n\n If we see that, okay, I don't know, the statistical forecast is way more accurate for some materials than the planner's input, then the planners can can start let the system do the plan for those materials. On the flip side, if we can see the system is not forecasting very well some materials or some plants, well, we need more time from the planners to put into these products, into these materials.\n\n And the only way we can measure that is a set taking photos, snapshots, and along with accuracy KPIs. We don't have the KPIs yet because the configuration phase hasn't finished, but we will add the KPIs for accuracy in each one of these steps. Once the process is finished, we will copy this key here for correcting maintenance and this is the key figure that will go into the inventory part, inventory planning part.\n\n"},{"start_time":1732178521271,"end_time":1732178612784,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"This is the demand tab is basically the tab for the demand planner. What the information being shown over here is the actual consumption and the reservations for the previous periods.

If it is, like for example, that 2027, if they feel that it is okay, And then they will just leave it now.\n\n Once that window, assume that this demand planning is happening, you know, in the first two weeks of the month on the first week, let's assume that it's happening on the first week of the month. Then what you are telling is the demand planner must take the action to review the key figures and, you know, make changes to the forecast in the week one. After the week one is over, he will not be able Since you will at the end of the week one, you will take a snapshot of this key figures and you will make it available for the inventory team.\n\n Assume that the inventory team is going to plan their part in the week two, so you will not allow them to edit these key figures.

Why they did not close it? I don't have any answer for this.

But this is a little different.\n\n It is not exactly the same as the order point planning. Based on the previous consumption, you are making a forecast and you are trying to ask the user to confirm the forecast. Now the question he may ask is, how do I have probably the future First thing is you may have you know a key figure for you have that you had the key figure for material reservation, right? So what he may see is OK for the 2025-2026.\n\n If there is then assume that there is he know OK there is this much this many reservations for the future and the forecast is showing me this."},{"start_time":1732179551092,"end_time":1732179553131,"speaker":{"name":"Sheth, Kunal"},"words":"Sorry, can you hear me?"},{"start_time":1732179553131,"end_time":1732179582730,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"Yes, yeah.

That's another shift in the entire process is that since today you were on reorder point planning, the maintenance planner used to plan something, but they used to put reservation in place of forecast, right? Now, one of the shifts probably which should happen is reservation should not be used for forecasting. Reservation should be used only for consumption. And if they need anything, like they need anything metal to be planned for future periods, This is where they'll come and simply say that this is where I need.\n\n So anyways, in some or the other way, people are planning their material and creating reservations upfront so that when they need material, the material is available. We are saying that since there is a shift between reorder point planning and the reservation-based planning, we use this tool for planning and making sure the material is available on time."},{"start_time":1732179636033,"end_time":1732179662616,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"But correct.

They will only simply say okay this is where I need material and I'm okay with this.

Rahul, that's fine. Forecast based planning is okay. See but I'm I assume that I'm a user you are asking me to correct some number over there. At least you know you are saying that, say for example 2025, four quantities are required, right? Then at least if I know that in the year 2025 the planned number of you know planned again, it may be a statistical. It has. It is not a real actual entry, in the year of 2025, maybe an informatory or a statistical line saying that this many quantities of reservation are there.\n\n Then he will say, okay, here you see, based on the previous five years, this is just my way of thinking. I may not be right, but it's saying that based on the previous actual consumption, you are proposing now that you need four quantities in 2025. Now, based on my requirement, requirements which I have in the system, how many do I need? If he gets a picture of that somehow, it will be helpful for him to adjust the quantities.\n\n Otherwise, he will see the number 4 and what will he do that?"},{"start_time":1732179792470,"end_time":1732179796197,"speaker":{"name":"Patel, Rahul"},"words":"So how does he come to know what is my requirement?"},{"start_time":1732179796197,"end_time":1732179804670,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"That is from the reservations which are getting created.

Now, you are saying that You are not going to give him any other input.\n\n Maybe I don't know from where he will. He will know, you know, maybe maybe the maintenance team knows. I don't know.

So let's understand on what basis they are coming up, and the proposal from our side is how IBP can make sure that this decision is automated in system, so you don't need to work around manually.\n\n You just see that whatever IBP has proposed is in alignment or it can help your current way of working. And then and once you get this confidence like probably in the testing you will have this confidence and once you get this confidence you will start relying on what IBP is proposing so this is the change from a maintenance perspective where there anyways planning there anyways requesting for reservations we are saying that don't use reservation for forecasting use the forecast for forecasting and review that and if the forecast or review is in line then we can use Yeah.\n\n I think that we need to jump.
