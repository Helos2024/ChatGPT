So, I think Vignesh just messaged to everyone like the firewall ticket is approved now.\n\n So, might be the Kaiser will do the testing if everything works fine then mostly the agent installation and configuration will be over by today itself and then we have to create the data stores might be in the next week."},{"start_time":1735288827853,"end_time":1735288828742,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"In CIDS?"},{"start_time":1735288828742,"end_time":1735288830075,"speaker":{"name":"Sagar Vora"},"words":"Yeah, in CIDS."},{"start_time":1735288830075,"end_time":1735288833185,"speaker":{"name":"Bastian Osorio"},"words":"So, but they give us the approval?"},{"start_time":1735288833185,"end_time":1735288834962,"speaker":{"name":"UNKNOWN_SPEAKER"},"words":"Not for the STD."},{"start_time":1735288834962,"end_time":1735288894952,"speaker":{"name":"Sagar Vora"},"words":"So, we are just doing the paralleling.

We don't want plant also in the same field and the storage location also in the same field, correct? As you said, we want it but for drilling. Correct. We will require per plant. Then in case Yeah, then in that case, we can, means if we want to do some testing, then we can try with ABAP, or else we can check with Renaldo, because he also knows ABAP, right?\n\n So for starting purpose, we can start with location, where we can see, like, if we can bring the storage locations in the plant field, and in one of the custom attribute field, we map up plants, which correspond to that storage.

These four are storage locations. These all will be customs. Now I'm not sure here we can bring SS. If we can bring then it's good or else we have to go with we have to go with S or P, anything. If S, if we are not able to bring N, then we have to go with P. And here we have a custom first FTTR1. There's a custom fields available.

It's absolutely fine. But of course, you understand that for MRO, for chemicals, what we're looking for is to integrate storage location.\n\n So I understand that you basically are killing two birds with the same stone, but it's fine. It is in an efficient way to do it. But at the end, what do we need here is storage location. So final definition is a storage location.

And maybe the filters we can, well, I don't know if I think on using if they have historical consumption well we integrate if they don't then we don't something like this but it's better to ask for them for a final definition in terms of filters I'm not sure if we have filter for that no we don't have anything else well so yeah pending filters the filters are pending okay but then again from from the extract I think this shouldn't suppose any challenge because what we are where we have challenges is in terms of location and in terms of activities.\n\n But in terms of customers, this is fine.
