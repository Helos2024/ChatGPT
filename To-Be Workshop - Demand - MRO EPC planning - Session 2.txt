And here we need to, we're going to ask some questions because we need to make some definitions. Okay. So here we have the planning calendar for EPC. Of course, this is a very planning calendar and we will define it at a lower level as we get more definitions. But the general process starts with the master data integration and validation.\n\n As it was described in the previous session, we start with the integration from S4HANA for the new materials. So we will schedule a job and there needs to be a responsible for were integrated successfully into IBP. Along with that, we will have the transactional data integration and again, validation."},{"start_time":1728983277074,"end_time":1728983509326,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Our starting point is that we're going to integrate the actor's recommended amount, right? But along with that, we can integrate more transactional data can add some value in the analysis. This activity also needs to have a responsible for checking that the job runs successfully and checking that the numbers make sense. Then we have two activities. The first one is reference material definition and review reference material for materials with history.\n\n So the first one, as we said, is to define find for the new materials what is going to be the reference material in which we're going to base to generate the subsequent forecast. We're going to dig a little bit going for the details once we finish this one, how we're going to determine what is the reference material. But after that, let's assume we define a reference material I don't know, one or two years has passed.\n\n And now we have a consistent consumption history, which we can use to generate now a forecast for the material itself. There is no need for or use a reference material. Then this is the activity that we have in here, review reference material for materials with history. So there will be a point where the reference, consumption history in the reference material is no longer needed. Why? Because the new material itself has a consistent, reliable consumption history.\n\n Of course, this will happen not that often because we need to have at least, I will say, at least a year if the material has a lot of consumption to considerable amount of information to create a forecast. This is an activity that will be performed on a quarterly basis. After that, we are ready to run the statistical forecast. As my colleague Hector mentioned, it is possible to schedule this statistical forecast, but our recommendation is that one key user runs the forecast for the entire company.\n\n Why is that? Because we can schedule the job for a determined date, let's say the 5th, the 10th in the month, but this date can vary depending on the planning calendar, right? So again, there is a need for a responsible to run each one of these steps. Once we the results of the statistical forecast, we can proceed to unlock users collaboration. This means that users were locked or blocked before this.\n\n What it means is that there should be an announcement, okay, proceed to go for the collaboration. Why is that? Because users have first to be sure that the new products were integrated, that the transactional data for the manufacturer's inputs was integrated, and the statistical forecast was integrated before they're looking at the information and saying, OK, this number is good, or this number is bad, and I need to change it.\n\n So that's why we have a block period, and then we unlock the collaboration."},{"start_time":1728983509486,"end_time":1728983511147,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 3"},"words":"Here, user, what do you mean by user?"},{"start_time":1728983511207,"end_time":1728983529016,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"Is it an end user, or it's inventory controllers I think it's the people who currently are collaborating in their process.

And we have two weeks for collaboration, but the user will be able to log in and look at the information all the time. It's just the first two weeks of the month are the users available to change the forecast for the few months. And at the end of the week two, let's say the end, the final day of the work week, the forecast review meetings will have place. And in that meeting, all the planners, with probably their managers, will look at the information on a high level and will determine if this is the right level that they're expecting.\n\n If there is any exception, let's say a spike on demand or a valley or any number that looks weird, it can be reviewed and addressed during that meeting. So after the meeting concludes and they agree on a final number, they can proceed to the next step, which is the demand plan release. So running a job, one key user will be responsible for running this job and this agreed forecast will be taken into the next step, which is the inventory planning and supply planning or the calculation of the reordered safety stock, reordered point, and then the subsequent supply planning for good choice requisitions.\n\n With that, now that the forecast was released, it was defined for this month, we will lock the user collaboration. After this meeting and the job run for release the forecast, users cannot change their forecast. It's not allowed. Why is that? Because we need to be we need to have certain traceability. They cannot change the number at any time in the month. And then we need to have a traceability.

Is business critical material which means if those materials are not planned the plant will stop.\n\n We cannot afford to not plan those materials and there is vital materials needs to be planned fortnightly, which means every 15 days, and then others can be monthly.

But also, we need to know how they – first, we need information about how they plant these materials on Laos currently, how they do it.\n\n They generate a purchase position on a weekly basis? How does it work? What is the lead time? Because again, if they're by their products, I assume that the lead time may be shorter than non-critical products.

But then when it comes to procurement, you would not depend on IPPs monthly cycle for procurement, you will still run the MRP on weekly level for such materials and still be able to procure them based upon your current procurement practice.\n\n So the improvement will be from an IBP perspective in the reorder points in the ST stock but then the supply planning will not happen from IBP for such materials if you wish to execute a job on a weekly basis"},{"start_time":1728984062171,"end_time":1728984139865,"speaker":{"name":"Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS)"},"words":"and still be able to procure them based upon because essentially Can you tell us why IBP cannot plan on a weekly basis?

I cannot do this cross-company availability check. These sort of features are not available in the SAP HANA system currently.\n\n Your depiction over here of a monthly, maybe for all the general material, is it not possible to have an MRP run based on, we can identify, there are factors which identify which material is a business continuity material, which material is a vital material. For those, if we pass the indicator to IBP, are we not able to, you are calling it as an supply planning, I am just calling it as an MRP execution, so you cannot execute the MRP there on a weekly basis, is it not possible to do that in the IBP?\n\n"},{"start_time":1728984139965,"end_time":1728984169267,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"It is possible, but, so first of all, for most of your materials, I don't know if for most, but for a lot of your materials you have consumptions that are are less than, I don't know, three or four consumptions per year.

A statistical value and they have put something called EPC collaboration.\n\n Probably, I think what they are asking is you take the forecast and review it, but I don't think we may do it, but I think there is this line over there. You see EPC collaboration. I think what they're trying to say is you take the output of the statistical forecast and just check with the EPC supplier whether these are confirmed values. Once that is getting confirmed, then they will lock the demand and then they are trying to run the inventory.\n\n Our process now is a little different in the sense we don't go and start collaborating, at least this is what I know as of now, because once the demand is coming from the EPC, that is our SPIR projects, manufacturer or the EPC is recommending their quantity. I don't know whether we need another EPC collaboration step over here to go and review the statistical forecasts with them.

And at the end, we will have a final number, which should be defined and based on certain logic. So there is an app called business role. And what we can do is to abilitate a key figure for each one of the different roles. Let's say that the inventory planners will have their own key figure, yeah, key figure, and the maintenance planner will have a different key figure.\n\n And we need to define which one of these will have the priority, okay? So here, there are two examples, okay? So the first one is, this is for a spur part. Let's call a spur part A for this example. So for the period one, we have that the manufacturer's quantity is 20. The statistical forecast gave us an empty value. And the planner's input, let's say the inventory control for this example, didn't put any number.\n\n So by default, the final forecast will be here, the manufacturer's input. Why? Because there is no statistical forecast, there is no planner's input. In the second example, we have a different logic, okay? We can see it in the period two, whereas we have a statistical forecast for 10, but there is no planner's input. In that case, the final forecast will be empty. Why is that? Because the first two values, the manufacturer's quantity and the statistical forecast serve as just a reference value, but they're not able to, they're not configured in a way that they take the final input as a final number.\n\n So it's the planner here that needs to put a number. And if they don't pull a number, then the amount that will be in the forecast will be empty, which again, coming back to the example one, is different, okay? If there's, and we can see it in the period two as well, we have statistical of 10, but there is no plans input. So in this case, the final forecast is 10. So what we need from you here are two things.\n\n First, define the different collaboration levels if we're going to have a different level for the inventories controller and for the planners input. And then what is going to be the logic? What is going to be the final forecast? It's going to be an average of the two. It's going to be the maximum or the minimum. Okay? So our recommendation is to make it, first of all, as simple as possible. And in a way that we can, there is clear accountability for the final number.\n\n That is mandatory. We need to have an accountability for the number. We cannot open the door to anyone putting a number and no one knowing who put that number in that, that then trigger Purchase Requisition or something, okay? And two more things. We have an option called Snapshot that allows to take a photo of the different values in a given period of time. So let's say now we're in October, so we will take a photo of the forecast for the next five years that was defined in October.\n\n Next, in the next planning cycle, let's say in November, we can compare what was said in October and compare it with the collaboration of the current month. Why is that useful? Because if we see, if we identify any big difference, we can go there and analyze what happened here. Why we said last month we said 10 and this month we said 100? Or why the last month we said 100 and this month we said 1?\n\n What's the reason behind that big gap?"},{"start_time":1728985031902,"end_time":1728985085675,"speaker":{"name":"Conference Room (MM- SKEC2 - L08) - Speaker 2"},"words":"The final thing, we can also activate something called change history.

You can put a message, save it for, I don't know, increasing new project or something like that.\n\n We have a reason code that we can link to every change.

I have one question which I'm not understanding fully. Let me share my screen. Currently, the process is working like this. Are you able to see my screen now? See, currently the process is working like this for the SPIR. The EPC contractor sends this to the manufacturer. Manufacturer recommends. It goes to the EPC. He provides his recommendation. Then it comes to our AdNoc project team.\n\n All this is happening within the SAP AIN tool. Then it comes to the cataloging team. Then it comes to the maintenance team. Then it comes to the inventory team. Here they are putting all their quantities. But what you are recommending now is something like this, where EPC will submit, vendor will be there, EPC. But once the cataloging team reviews the specification of the material, again I've taken out the boxes, but maintenance team can still be involved, but not to review the stocking parameters.\n\n Probably they may be involved to check any other specifications or something like that. But here what you want the data to be replicated to the SAP HANA. From SAP HANA, you want it to go to the IBP, and in the IBP here, probably the maintenance team, you will have them. Currently, like I told you in the previous module here, it's a mandatory step. It goes to the maintenance team, they have to review the SPIR request, and then they will confirm their recommended quantity.\n\n Since we are taking, we are probably not expecting them to do that over here. Probably in the IBP tool, you are going to have a task and this is what you are saying as the EPC collaboration, something like that, where they provide their input. Then once they provide their input, I think you lock their demand and then forecast whatever, and then it will come to the inventory team.

Now I'll come to the question where I did not understand when the supplier is or when the manufacturer or the contractor, when they are submitting, they submit, you know, a quantity saying that I recommend you, you know, to have for your two year operations, say, for example, 15 pieces of this spare part, right? They don't I mean, they don't break break up, you know, by period.\n\n We don't have a breakup, you know, by period because what you showed over there in the screen is period one, period two. I am assuming that period is a monthly period, you know, so I'm assuming I'm not. So, so, so who will actually. So every month. See, currently the process is they don't get, you know, into every month review cycle whenever. Currently, the way it works is if the stock falls below the reorder point or if it's a demand-based planning, whenever there's a requirement, it will plan or if it falls below the reorder point, it will plan.\n\n This is what happening today. But in the future, we are talking only about the EPC scenario now.

But you're right. That is not demand. So conceptually, you are right. These numbers are different because the second, statistical forecast and the planner's inputs is demand, but the manufacturer's input is an initial required stock.

Can you open the slide again, 21 just to make sure we can review this. So what we understand, Murugan, from your input, we are talking about the same process where we are able to identify the demand from the manufacturer for the SPIRs and initiate the procurement of those spares after collaboration. With the maintenance team. Now the proposal here to have this as a monthly planning cycle because there are steps which are to be executed in IPP one after another for us to be able to do the supply planning.\n\n So there are two points which we need to discuss and understand and conclude here is whether this can be more than monthly cycle. We don't want, we don't expect that it should be less than monthly cycle, but if you think that needs to be in quarterly activity or this can start at a certain phase of the project. The EPC project can be of two years but then the maintenance, the spare part planning only happens after one year which means that this activity can be triggered after one year and continue for say six months till all the spares are planned for those specific project and then this becomes then this for that specific EPC project this activity stops and then you are just monitoring whether the required procurement has happened or not and whether the stock is available as per what which was planned.\n\n Now this is one EPC project. You might have more than one EPC project always going on, which means you will need some other other way for people to collaborate and discuss about those specific projects. One project may have a separate life cycle, but then at an ad hoc level when you're planning the EPC, you would need a forum interact and confirm whether the demand for specific project at an ad-hoc level is concluded.\n\n So the intention of this meeting is not to have one meeting for every project but an ad-hoc level or we can define the grouping at it can be at group company level it can be at material group level or it can be at ad-hoc level that at what level such a process needs to be executed can be an input but then it makes sense for people to collaborate, come together in a monthly cycle, provide their input, confirm on the demand so that the next planning processes can be executed.\n\n So the intention of having this monthly planning cycle is to make sure that we are following the steps which are required for IPP to execute. At the same time, we are formalizing the entire process."},{"start_time":1728987373277,"end_time":1728987408071,"speaker":{"name":"Murugan Kaliaperumal (ADNOC - PE&ICV)"},"words":"Sir, whatever you're discussing, high level, I don't understand anything what you said now.

At the time of handover or commissioning. Now this is where the SPIR process comes.\n\n Okay now let us let us let us Murugan please correct me wherever you know. Okay so now the SPIR process is not the project phase. I am going to award an EPC lump sum. Okay he is going to procure you know the assets, install the equipments. Now at the end of the project during the commissioning he is going to tell, okay. Let's take one simple example. Assume that there are 10 pieces of an equipment, okay, which has been installed in a plant.\n\n Now assume that the supplier is saying that you need 10 spare parts to maintain 10 equipments. Now maintenance and inventory may review and say, I don't need to stock 10 spare parts, okay. I can stock, say, five. Now what they do is, when they take that decision, they create something called as an SPIR PO. Will be placed to the EPC contractor saying that yes, five of these spare parts I am going to buy.\n\n So what happens is I will have the five pieces with me. Now what happens this is now we also are going to maintain the reorder point. What we are trying to say is that this what the what we have taken is we need to keep an optimal level of 5 pieces.

Nothing is there during aggregation, segregation, SPR package comes from one specific manufacturer and the order goes back to the same manufacturer. It doesn't go through a tendering process. There is no PR for it.\n\n There is a PO placed directly on the manufacturer who gives the SPR package to us. Right? So no demand aggregation segregation over there. In that package, if there are 100 item records, sorry, material numbers, and we decide to buy out of 100 only 20 numbers, those 20 numbers alone will be moved to purchase order with the approved quantity. Total 100 items goes into the metals master. Right?

So that particular MRP demand aggregation segregation concept will work over there it has nothing to do with this uh scope maybe in this in this cycle I mean but we are discussing for aggregation like hierarchies like the material hierarchies the plant hierarchies the asset hierarchies so we can see information on reports on dashboards and things like that For this particular SPR related topic, the only source is SPR number document, I would say, like PO number, SPR number.\n\n That is the reference.
