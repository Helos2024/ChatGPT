No, because we are going to have reorder the voice, reorder the point-based planning then why you need a forecast in first place.

Or if they do, the data is not right. Because the big difference of this model, MRO, IVP, MRO, and the PM, plant maintenance, is that IVP assumes, or it was designed under the assumption that we have the with the activities and that's rarely happened and basically that you can get rid of mostly half of the design if you don't have the BOM.\n\n"},{"start_time":1735216603163,"end_time":1735216684989,"speaker":{"name":"Hector Palacios"},"words":"Yeah and I'm expecting that if you have preventive maintenance well maintained that that is driving most of the demand for sure.

Why driving the model basically is to have a very strong plan of preventive maintenance, and we can run IVP, the calculated safety stock, and so on.\n\n But that's the weak point, that the preventive maintenance is not as great as we expect. So I think that for me, The ideal model, if I'm being honest, is like you have reorder point for everything that is corrected, right? And you calculate a safety stock and so on. And for preventive maintenance, we still have a forecast for that. So we prepare in anticipation to that and so on, right? But the reorder point that we are planning is not considering preventive maintenance.\n\n It's just correcting. So you have usually a very tiny stock only for just in case.

And Vivek came up with the idea of using basically the inventory target, but smartly.\n\n So with a certain logic that is here, basically. This is our logic. Set key figures in the background.

Whenever we need to order, we change the inventory target to the maximum. So it's going to order to the maximum.
