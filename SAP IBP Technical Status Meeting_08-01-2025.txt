Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Good afternoon everyone. Good morning. Good morning everybody.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Good Rahul, you're back great man.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I I I'm there only, but because of all different priorities I wasn't able to connect here, but Kunal was covering for me.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah yeah yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I was sorry good. Any luck with our access to be a bridge? See there are two tickets now the fire.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
I'll tell you, I don't know whether you know the story behind this.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I got to know the story that says the IPs are like dynamically allocated exactly.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
So every time they open the video it picks up in you. So finally we had a long call. We had to rope in. Folks from different sectors in AdNoc and we realized that we have to A group in which. All these people will be put and they would be assigned a particular series. I think to the third level so that you know even if it if it picks up the first based on the first three series would be allowed. Now I can see that the group is already created, so let me just pull in another to the call.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So essentially what you are doing is you're creating a separate group for us and allocating a different IP range only for our people. So that IP range can be whitelisted so that we don't whitelist the entire media IP range.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
This is what I understand because again, this is an entirely different area. It's like Greek and Latin for me. OK, I'm just going by the flow so.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So you like the challenges we are facing are like next level. The complexity of the challenges Next level. So I got. One minute this group was created.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Just let me look at the status of this ticket or once again, yeah. And then we can add people to the group, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So the group is created.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Does it include any people or we need to? Once the group is created, we need to add people to that group.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
See, I think when you have new people who want access to brute site, then we will have to ask. People who created the group to add these users to that group. So in the sense we.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Required, so do you think we can write a bad like I can because you had the list. There are a couple of more people which we may require, so is it is something we can write?

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
I would say let the stuff start working. OK, we know that OK in the group.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Then let's do it for others.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah, yeah, so. One second.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't know if others are joining today or is it only us? Yesterday we had this to do with it in that call, right? I mean yesterday yesterday. No, I was not there yesterday. There was a status meeting.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
I think where we had a larger audience and I and I. King, there is some delay that they're going to rework on that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's the weekly schedule. Yeah, I could not join that because of other things, but yeah. This is more technical and short, the smaller audience.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
In fact, I think a lot of work I mean. And all we've already done in couple of sessions by screen sharing option.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, so yeah, that's that's I really appreciate your help on helping us making sure that the work at least gets going. So now really we need to access the system on our own and to make sure that the data shows up on what are things I think replication also happened.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
The data replication. So look at this is the status of the group creation. OK, it's assigned to. Ask us the lobby and No, it's it, but that means so. Let me see if I if we can add fulfillment I already right, which means that and who is the administrator of the group? I've got no idea yet. I have no idea.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is this is an 80 group or what kind of group? I think it would be an 80 group, right? Which means someone would be in owner. Generally this they give the administrator access to someone in the business, which means users can be added and removed from the group.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
So I I don't know whether it's an email ID group or it's something else.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So they're grouping by email, right? They've asked for email, right?

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
They have asked for email. But at a firewall level, how does it work?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Group and probably there will be something. OK, let's let's wait for the confirmation of group and then maybe the maintenance would be pretty easy there once once the group is formed.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
So I'm trying to get in touch with her.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let us see what she says.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
OK, and the other ticket. So once it's done.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It will update the number range for the group and then it goes feeds the other ticket.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Exactly, so we will update. So I will just wait for this to get completed so that I could do that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, got it. Thanks Nishant. Anything else we have? Oh, we have Paula.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Hey hi Paula. Yes, good morning everyone.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Good morning. I don't know where you are.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
It's morning or afternoon. Just arrived in the office. So let me update you on the SAP incident. I was just writing to the current person who is owning it. I will let you know as soon as possible. This person, our cloud expert will solve Hopefully this morning I was just chatting with him.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, so the only thing is now we've done with all other activities. The only thing which is right now we are waiting for and so we would request your support to make sure we are trying to close this as soon as possible because if it crosses this week it will start eating our time again. So no, no, no.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
I will try to to push. I'm already in contact with him.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK. Hello.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Good to see everybody on.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah, I think this is this. We should have this more camera thing now. Yeah, no, I I didn't notice this thing that you know just pops out when I when I just press on the top of this. So I just tried it and put great.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We want to see we want.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I'm more eager to see I never heard him though, I mean.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Yeah, it's a note taker. Yeah, yeah, it's a note taker. So I know so that's Kunal man. I mean you look different from what I think. Thought of okay right because I had another friend called Kunal so it was different okay. Akkha is okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Hey Vignesh.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Hi Vignesh.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Hello everybody.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah so we just got an update from Nishant about Buruj access so just for everyone's understanding since our static uh since the VDI IPs are dynamically allocated we are not able to get approval for bypassing the firewall between AdNoc and Guruj. So they're creating a separate group for us, allocating a new IP range only for our group, and that IP range would be whitelisted for access. So there are two tickets in progress, and Nishant is following up on those tickets.

 So once the group is formed, new IP range is allocated to that group, and that IP range is whitelisted on firewall. We will be able to access Burujas for HANA. Right now, we cannot access Burujas for HANA, and Nishant has helped us complete the activity from a configuration perspective on screen sharing. Paola has updated on the work which SAP is doing, and she confirmed that she will help us expedite.

 We don't have margin beyond this Friday, so we've requested Paola's help to make sure that we are able to close activity by this Friday or else it will start further heating up our timeline in terms of delay.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Paola, Michael has declined the meeting, soâ€¦ No, no, let me explain. Michael is located in US Pacific time, so very far from us, so I have asked the support of two additional security experts in EMEA time zone yesterday. So we were able to have two additional SAP security experts.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, OK, so we'll be able to have this call right then?

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Yes, we don't need Michael in that case then. No, I mean there was a internal discussion between Michael and the colleague, so the colleague are briefed. Let's discuss today where we are with this part. Okay. All right. Because the last week we did the call with Michael, but it was very late, I think, for you. It was 4 p.m. Our time, so I think 7 or 8 your time. So anyway, we will have this call later on today.

 Okay.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
All right. Thank you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Next update is we received the design board approval for starting the build activities in development so Khalil will need your help to or probably Kaiser and Nishant can help us to get our access in development environment for our project

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
team.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So you need to yeah so once based on the approval you need to have the list of user ids with the roles okay and you need to send it to Kunal for his approval that these users need access to the development environment, so please grant us access.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So when you say roles, we need to tell the SAP S4 HANA roles required for this?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, so who can help us identify the roles in terms of how the roles are defined in AdNoc? How do we identify the roles required for users? Or we simply say this is a developer, this is a I think there is an Excel sheet template which we need to fill in.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I will check that out and send it to you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, if you can send it, then I'll update that Excel sheet and based upon today's upload, I'll right away get this approved by Kunal so that we can take it forward.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So I assume once the Kamil is approved, this goes to the security team, Sagar's team. OK, so do we communicate over email or we And then it's it's actually Kunal will forward it to them and then yeah yeah okay noted he will he will allocate so he will allocate he should Sagar should allocate one

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
resource to work with us in the project from the security point of view okay this will also include to create the system users we've created in sandbox for our interface and then Sagar from an activity perspective do we need to do Anything along with the installation of S4 HANA, the IBP components on S4 HANA. Any other activity which we need to do related to interface? Three ideas what we have done today.

 Any activity needs to report?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Repeat, sorry.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For the component installation, of course you need to approach Kessler. That you need to create a CR or whatever. You know you need to approach him and for the access to the system you need to approach Sagar and once you have access to the system then you will be logging in and doing the activities and yeah and yes one very important thing based on this you will be creating a release charm will be created and the TRs will be created and those TRs those will the project TRs okay okay so critical activities for that.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, before we can start any work, we need to steer the charm to be created so that yes, yes, the project. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. OK, I'm just taking with Sagar Vodaf. Sagar from from our interface perspective, whatever activities we've done in the last couple of weeks with respect to CIDS, DSA and IBP, anything needs to be repeated for development environment which we've done for sandbox other than the add-on component which we know already that that has to be implemented.

 No, I think so, but currently like we are.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We are going ahead with the basic authentication, basic authentication, but we have to.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, so I understand from an interface person whatever activities what we have done. I'm just saying that just because now we will be will be today we are working on sandbox S4 HANA tomorrow with this approval will will have the actual to the actual development environment to start our work, which means whatever activities we did from an add-on installation perspective in S4 HANA, we need to repeat that activity in development environment.

 That's for sure we need to do it. Any additional activity with respect to CIDS DSA interface-related activity, which we have done in past couple of weeks, which we need to repeat again, is the question.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, in CIDS, we have to create a separate data store. As for developing box. OK.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And that for that data store you also need the access for the system users from development, right? Yes. Noted OK, so then there are two activities which I think which we need to do after we get to the first. First we'll get the term created will get access to the system will install the add-on components and while the add-on components getting implemented we'll start this data store creation on CID side.



UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And we have to load data again in that extractor. So for now, I was not there for the one year, but for Burush, I took a Nishant's help. But now, once my ID is available in both the system, then I can perform that activity.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah. So because whatever we did right now was with sandbox system. So we'll have to do it again with development system.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
One more thing. Rahul, you're done? I have one important thing to discuss. So regarding the Excel add-on, which we need to install on the client PCs. So I have created a request to install it in my PC, but I think going forward, we will need to have it to be installed on the user's PCs as well. Kaisar I need your I will need your help to download the file from the SAP link because I've created a request but I don't think client support may will have access to that SAP portal to download the data even myself I don't have access to download.



Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay no problem Khalid I'll download and I'll share it but just for your information so you can you can ask the desktop support team to install this in your desktop. But going further, they will not allow this. So they will ask you to package this solution with the help of the one domain packaging team. So they will package this in the one image package. They will include this in the one image package, then any new PC will have, you know, they will have to install this, they'll just push that package.

 So that is a very lengthy process that goes through multiple security approvals. So better you initiate it now. Okay, do we need to do that?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We do not want to roll it to all the users we have like, I think we should be doing it because somewhere at the end of January we will have a kind of unit testing where end users would need access to IPP. So if we know that it takes time, then we should initiate it immediately so that we will need to give access to at least key end users who will be part of our testing.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The unit is what we're planning to do. OK, OK, we'll initiate this request then. What I mean to say because packaging means that it's going to all the users in adnoc right yes sir right right correct so regardless of that I mean if you have 10 users 100 users it has to be packaged

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
in any way it has to be packaged yeah so packaging means it has to go through security approvals compliance approvals and I am not sure even if they will allow to install this in your desktop unless it is approved by security. So anything which is not listed in the software directory in the one hub page, then they will ask you to get a security compliance endorsement.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And does the existing STD will do because we are our STD is almost approved except for risk and compliance.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It should be part of this thing, right? Your sdd document if it is not there then better include it now.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Kunal it is there?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
yeah interface we have mentioned xladdin user interface yeah okay so in the you know there is a section in sdd document the the interfaces or interface or something. Don't remember just a minute. I'll tell you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you pull up that document Kunal quickly? Like while we are on the call, let's open it and see if that makes sense while Kajal is on the call.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, let me open that.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What's that? Where is that section that?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I can. I can also open a problem. Let me see if. Yeah, let me open it.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So that section is related to which devices users will use. And what, uh, you know softwares they would need on the on those devices. So this. Excel add-in should go in that section.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is it in the I'm sharing my screen. We're sharing my screen, but we see us only, not the document.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Oh, really? Yeah.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Wait a minute.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar, do you have the latest IBP Excel editing as a handy so that we can share with Khalid to be part of that request?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, I don't have, but I can download.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
where is it integration hardware yeah look at the integration integration is okay this time dimension so infrastructure application design shouldn't be here 1.4 1.4 architecture in the architecture we have mentioned but uh kaiser is specifically mentioning in some other

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
section which can be referred by during the approval scroll down yeah so in the screen but you didn't have any mention any details about the Excel add-in right it's I mean you can refer this but you know you have

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
to specifically mention that this this is a desktop software and it has to be installed on the users a desktop or VDIs or laptops so there there is one particular section here can you advise me where we can mention

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
see this is the sdd I have this is a list of uh just contents and hosting infrastructure yeah exactly endpoints and client devices is there right yeah this one here okay this is we've updated the name there is a

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
comment there can you look at the comment on the right is it related to this only yeah what was the comment So Kunal and Sagar let's update this that how this will be accessed both the Fiori UI as well as the Excel UI details of the Excel plugin and then that it needs to be installed on the users who would like to access the IPP. This is a part of an add-in on Microsoft Excel. Do we need to provide details about the add-in, like the version or any technical information about the add-in?



Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think the latest version we can mention here is 24-11.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Or from where it has to be accessed in terms of getting that application? Anything else needs to be mentioned here other than the that we need to install this add-in.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I mean you just mentioned the version and yeah version should be enough you don't have to mention from where. Cassette but the version would be changed right like we will always need the latest one. But whatever version you will actually you know start with yeah just mention that thing.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay and then probably Sagar and Kunal we can also mention that this is the latest version which will be installed and then as SAP publishes the latest version, that version has to be upgraded to the users who are using it. And I think the version changes will happen at the backend, right? Your IT team will push the latest versions whenever these are available by SAP.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You have to request it actually. Whenever there is a latest version, you have to request it. Via ServiceNow Ticket.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And who does this? This is someone from IT, does it? Because if it, once we go live and once it goes into the, from a project perspective, it goes beyond projects resources, then from AdNoc, do you have any team who monitors the versions of the tools and make sure that the applications are used are of latest version?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No no nobody monitors that so the the owners who requested this app you know this client tool to be deployed that person has to actually you know keep monitoring if there is any latest version and users would need that then you have to request it so what they the deployment team does only the deployment they don't care about like version and all but before the deployment team, the security and compliance regulations would come in.

 So they will actually scan every time they'll scan this software and then they will approve it. Then it goes to the deployment team.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Noted. So every version will go through the process again and again.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Every time we need to like update it. Let me comment that there is a compatibility matrix between SAP IBP version and Excel add-in version. So usually, if I can say, usually my customer are doing the Excel add-in upgrade once or twice a year, basically. But this depends on you, how much you want to invest on it. What is important is remain in the official compatibility timeframe, of course. OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Kesar, I'm sharing my screen.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I just opened the template which was shared by Khalid during the initial day. So this is the default content which was coming. So here they are saying that this table has only to be filled if the solution has specific requirement deviating from AdNoc standard desktop laptop and it's pre-installed software.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, right. So this is not a pre-installed software, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So we have to fill in this section.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Right. So this, it won't be iPad. I think it would be standard desktop laptop. So only one row would be required. And here in the remarks, we can add the IBP XL edit.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's it. Khalid, is there, do you use any of the mobile devices for Any Fiori based application today on AdNoc?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
We use.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For plugin, I'm not sure it would be the desktop or the laptop category, but then if for Fiori, if it's being used today, do we mention separately for IPP or whatever being used today should allow them to access IPP

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
as well, right? We don't have a native application, right?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, we don't have application, but it's just an access so. For that access, do you need any other application which is specific to head? Not like the one here is mentioning that sidekicks workplace app. Generally, if you have to access company created softwares, you needed this workspace app which allows you to connect to your office environment through mobile devices.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
yeah we have some mobile applications like one hub and from where we are accessing I don't know at this stage should we mention this or okay let's then focus only on the excel add-in which is a desktop or laptop

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
yeah yeah yes yes maybe in future dashboard analytics might be required for to add iPad to take the decision on the fly. Even the approval also they can do on iPad, especially for the supply plan, demand plan, which we discussed.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
OK.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But then the assumption here is that the people who are accessing today have the necessary applications on their devices, which allows them to connect And this is additional probably Internet access only because there is no specific application, right?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If you have access to the browser and then your Fury and you should be able to access it, right? Yeah. Uh, is this the right request type for the for this?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no, this is not the one.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
So if you don't need me anymore, I will drop from the call, OK? OK, OK. OK, Paula. Thank you.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Paula, just one update for Paula. Thank you. Now, tell me. One update for Paula, that today we are able to access the ticket which was raised by Kaiser. The thing is, the CIDS organization they have referred to some other organization. So what they have done is, IBP instance, CCF, they have assigned to some other organization. So we have requested to do it for 184, which is for the ad hoc.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
So that is the latest update from the ticket, Paula. You are speaking about the ticket IBP instance that is not visible?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no, no.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Now it is visible in the Hector's ID. Sagar and I were able to see that ticket and Sagar is also updated because somehow they have assigned the CCF IBP instance to other CIDS organization, that is 183 instead of 184.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Okay, it appears, now I'm reading your comment, it appears that CCF is being provisioned to the wrong CIDS organization. The CIDS organization we have and that we have mentioned our ticket is the SA184. Could you please move? Okay. Let me copy this part and I will send it directly to the colleague. Sorry, I didn't show this part. Thank you for updating me.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

ROSSI, PAOLA:
Perfect. In case of additional question, I will write you an email. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Talk to you later.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Bye bye bye.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I said you have any. Reference for that. What I'm trying to find with the package.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, no software and apps is there, right? Other than the left hands or you just search desktop software search for desktop. On the left hand side you see the software and apps. OK.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, find and download.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
download software just go there. Yeah, these are the softwares that are, you know, they are already pre-approved.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, exactly.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there is there will be some other category here other other clients of yeah, exactly.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
You have to.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, you guys need me.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Can I jump?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, the companies before that mission is this needs to be done. Or whatever we do here will be applicable for Burujan one year to be both like Burujan at not both.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Not necessarily will have to do be done separately in some of the cases.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So. Then let's take this point Nissan separately.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you just check if this? So I mean I will. I will ping you later in the day.

Nishant Keloth (Borouge):
Let's discuss it. I just need to jump in another call.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No problem. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Then you can copy it. I created the same for myself. Okay, but it doesn't mention anywhere package here.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Actually, when you mention the add-in details, they'll go and search this pre-approved list. If they don't find it, then they will route it to compliance.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
you see let me show you let me show you what I have done see I have created same thing I have done see this one I created the request I mentioned the details the same thing installation SAP IVP all this thing so this is right this mean I have done right right yeah I'll wait for the response then yeah okay so this will trigger this package creation action is since the software is not part of the approved list.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
College then I think probably you can also put the software exe file whatever it is. That's what I was trying to do.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I was trying to download. I don't have the access.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
To download it from

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
like if you can but I don't know if Sagar can download and send it to me because the exe file coming from outside the adnok network he's using adnok only right vdi so I guess if within vdi if he

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
can download it using his credentials Sagar is that something you can do let me try you try you try yeah you try yeah I will update yeah I think you need a download manager you need to install the download

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
manager that is where I was so I do not have download manager installed in my PC.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, or anyone from your team maybe can help us. No, what do you want?

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I can help right away. Tell me you want to download this software, right? You have that software.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can go to the software center. Me.sap.com I'll send you the link and then we have to search there sapibpxl addon and from there we have to me.sap Yeah, go to service and support on the left. Yeah, and you will see a download software. Yeah. Can you type here SAP IBP?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Excel.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, which one we should do latest one 24 11 last one 24 11.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah, yeah. OK. OK, let's share this file.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I will attach there in the Vignesh was able to install this plugin. Yeah, but he was he did it on his private PC. Oh, he did it on his private PC. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So because I think, OK, that's how the even OSM team is able to access AdNoc. Yes, yes, yes, yes. None of us have access to this through AdNoc or VDI.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's why this issue has never been discussed. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now is the time to.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, I think I'll attach it with the request. Thank you, Kesar.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No problem. Thank you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So I think this is the only point we wanted to discuss, right? So Kunal and Sagar, please make sure that we are updating this endpoint software information in the STD. So that Khalid when he's he's referred the STD details or the RITM for STD in the ticket. So if anyone checks, they can find this information.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, we directly update on the SharePoint.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, OK, alright, thank you and and Rahul.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Would you like to just run through the run book part which we discussed yesterday? Yeah, that was one of the thing.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Do you think we will be able to go through the run book? Kaiser Vignesh College. So based upon the request we've created this and book. So we just wanted to run it once to review with the team. Show it Kunal.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, this is for capturing all the cut over tasks and each environment what to do.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is this what you mean by runbook? Yeah, that is for the I think one second. That is for the IBP integration activity which we have done.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK, you just share with what does this runbook mean? OK.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
These are the step by step. Which we need to perform to set up the integration between IBP and S4 HANA.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And this is like a fine. This is a runbook you are calling it. This is more like a configuration, you know, sort of rational. They are calling it configuration rational in the SAP. But what I want to also, you know, tell you is, now let me, let me tell you, this is, can you go down? You may have all the screenshots, each step, you know, mentioning and this is the architecture fine go down you take screenshots from the system right yeah yeah so here uh this is our overall architecture so this step is only

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
catering this integration between cids and dsa and what are the prerequisite to perform these steps along with the skin all this all this must be all this must be done fine yeah this is one thing you need to you

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
need to document this which is good so that you are kept all of this when you are doing it. This is good, but what also required you know, see I'll share my screen. Can you see my screen? Prepare one like I told you if you are able to see my screen. Yes, I'll show you this from another project. Are you able to see this? Yes, yeah, see what is what is happening? Assume that you are performing a list of activities on the development environment, correct?

 Now, you are put all the screenshots you have put over here, but you need to capture them as a checklist like task one, which system this is being done, either on the DSA agent or on the SAP HANA, what is the activity name, and also who is doing this, either is it being done by AdNoc or you guys, And who's the owner? And when you why we do this because when you move from ER6 to ER5. Mostly you will not be redoing the DSA and the this configuration because it will already see ideas.

 Configuration is a one time only two times you're going to do this one for the test and one for the prod, correct? Yeah, there are activities on the SAP side each environment like deployment add-on, configure, whatever parameters, you actually keep a track of this saying that in this system, this action will be done, status, who's doing, AdNoc team or your team, and then how much data it took. Now, from the development perspective, the first thing, development, you will have more activities probably because you're setting up the DS and CADS connection and all those things.

 Ultimately when we go live, right? I will. I will refer to this check check task list or checkbook and I will try to ensure that all of them. So you see every time when we move from one environment to another, we we ensure that it's completed. So it's like a recurring task and the same thing for the development. Whatever you task that you have done manually to set up the system which need to be part of the checklist.

 You don't mention it over here. Give references if you want. You know sometimes it could be some SAP help documents or something. If you want you give some references for later and in this sheet only Rahul, I told you just put a bracket and And and you know, make the RITM number which we have used for that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, so in the sheet in this sheet only you want us to add the details of the stakeholders and the approvers of those.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I should when I go for production because you're not going to do this once again, right? You're not going to do this once again until we go to production, but I wanted to be tracked in some tracker sheet so that when I raise the request for production I will go copy that RITM and create it with just changing the IP addresses.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That's all OK. OK, so this is part of the cutover, right? This is one of the cutover. This is exactly the cutover sheet. Probably the only thing we can do right now Kunal is that because the cutover sheet preparation as a task is part of SIT. Before we finish the SIT and go to UAT, we'll have this activity fine. But by the time we reach there, we may miss or forget whatever steps we did internally in AdNoc to get to the point where we are, right?

 So it's better if at least fall from an interface public to whatever different request trees, firewall approvals we received based on all the conversation we have. Let's identify those activities and start building it together. So I can see it is already shared a list of activities, which is something similar to what you highlighted in a different format in the chat. But then probably we need to evolve it further to the point where we are able to capture all the steps, which are not only the configuration and SAP systems, but also the external approvals required within AdNoc to make sure that the system works fine.

 And that we have specified as a prerequisite in the steps.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you show that Kunal?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And also probably that if we have this information captured somewhere, then it can be easily converted to the Excel sheet because anyways we'll be preparing this cutover sheet as part of of the project activities.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Only thing is we are going to do this only once for the see. That is why I want you to just capture it now. You will not get another chance to do it. Yeah, you know, yeah, I agree.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because we've been through a lot of different conversations across teams to come to a point where we are. We don't want to reinvent it again when we reach production.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, I think we see it is captured in the drone book or not in my Excel. So the Excel which I. Share the screenshot there we can include some more steps like the RTIM number and what are the prerequisites.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So here the proxy details and address port number which we have actually done with reference to the ad hoc request number.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Here can you can you update the RITM details so that see if this is done and if we know the RITM we can always go back to that RITM number identify what all information we use and create the same RITM for production when we have to do it again.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct. Yeah.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So basically, we have raised two RITM to have a connection between CIDS and DSA. So one is for the web proxy, and second for the HQ Firewall.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah. Yeah.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So only two RITM would be required.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, two RITM. Yes, you're right. Because both of them are created with my user ID.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Kunal this one the one through the certificate for that we do not need any firewall opening the one from DSA directly to the IBP. Between this to this? The dotted line on the top.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
On the top IBP to right side.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah this one.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No I think this this activity we already completed with the help of kaiser and the sap cst no so it is not because the dsa agent is also on the that what is that heck no so maybe I don't yeah heck network okay so khalid we need to repeat the same activity when we do the cutover for the product Again, we need to raise a ticket for SAP to perform this activity together with the SAP CS team. Because DSA is hosted on the HAC network, and they only have an access to that.

 So basically, what Sagar has done, during the screen sharing, Sagar has entered the username and password, as well as upload the certificate. And then we have successfully established the connection between CIDS and DSA.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
yeah okay okay this mean there is no direct connection between DSA and IBP right it's only for the certificate it is only for the certification yeah sorry you were saying something that user ID actually I'm concerned about that user

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So when we were integrating this DSA with IBP yeah we have entered a user id right so yeah I'm not sure if that had been discussed with sap because we used I guess sagar's user id right so just reminding that don't forget that guys because that is very important you know to address and then fix it yeah in the further environments at least yeah we have discussed this with sap also So SAP said this is the only

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
approach. But currently for CCM, we have used MyID. But going forward for the other environments, we can plan for some other email ID, like from the AdMob team.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Email ID. But the problem is, see, we cannot use anyone's email addresses, right? Especially any individual email addresses cannot be in inserted in that configuration. So. If we require, you know. A kind of dummy email address or. System email address. Like a service account email address, then that has to be created.

Vignesh Perumal (ADNOC Group D&CS):
That also will require an RITM process and

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, and someone should actually also have the access to that inbox vignesh because the password request yeah that password request would be in notification would be received in that inbox and you know someone has to reset it so this is something I mean I don't like this you know this process from sap they they are complicating the processes rather simplifying this So now we cannot get a dummy email address from AdNoc.

 And even if we get a dummy email address, they will not give us an inbox actually for that email address.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is as good as setting up an actual user.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is there any other way? I think that's the only way. But I just want to check when SAP provided the CIDS tenant. Might have raised basically the licensing and everything. So that time they might have provided one email ID through which someone might have entered into the CIDS and created the other email IDs.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Khalid, you received it. You created my account, right?

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The first one, right? Yes. Yeah. Actually, it was actually first one. Very first one was received by Firaat. But for us you can so then I created an ticket created my ID and then I give an effect you did it for IBP right did you do it for CIDS no no I did not do anything for CIDS

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Was directly caster I think right yes yeah but even if we create further users but we don't have access to the inbox right we we can put any dummy email address is and then create a user right but the password notification would go to that user's inbox.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The concern using your email is that since you are on single sign-on you cannot log in with user ID and password is the concern if we have to use your.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No as per the compliance regulations we are not supposed to use individual user IDs for a system-to-system communication yeah so this is why I don't understand why SAP is bringing you know these such processes of integration I think this

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
is the point which was raised by the compliance right Kunal yeah from Santam is yeah yeah we have a meeting today at 4 p.m. To discuss this yeah yeah with SAP Yesterday I have sent you the invite but I've seen like you if you can join for some time maybe set 4 p.m. 4 p.m.

Mohammed Khaiser Khan (ADNOC Group D&CS):
right I have this fury architecture meeting until 5 but anyways I'll see if I can join for just 5 minutes but this is something very critical guys we have to actually you know address this with SAP either our understanding is wrong or something SAP is not you know communicating to us but I'm sure SAP is a matured company right they cannot you know allow customers to implement such silly vulnerable things yeah so let's discuss with the security team now because yeah so we have restrictions here so in creating you know the email addresses of unknown persons no adnoc will not allow creating inboxes or email addresses for unknown individuals or unknown users so that's the point we should you know communicate to SAP so SAP should address this somehow or should provide some alternative.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, then this is noted and will take up in today's call with SAP at 4 p.m. Anything else from anyone? Kunal, what you can do is also send this, add this runbook on a AdNoc SharePoint and send it to Khalid and Kaisar and Vignesh for them to review Anandha and Nishant as well from Buruj.

Khalid Sarfaraz (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So that if there is any feedback from any of the team members, we will. Can you rename it to configuration rational? Because this is a term which we are using. Or is that different? Instead of calling it runbook, say configure. Because I see even in the index, you I'm saying configuration. Yeah, it is more of a configuration configure. Yeah, yeah, let's say it configuration rational because this is some even this is a requirement from our analysis at deliverable, right?



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah. OK. Anyone have any other questions?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, OK, yeah, OK, then Sagan Kunal.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Can you stay back on I just probably if they have other things probably can drop them.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Thank you. And it's either by conduct of India. From Mumbai. From where in Mumbai? Next week on it. No, no, I live in Mulund, next to the police station.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Mulund is in the east and west? Yes, in the west.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Near Vardhaman Nagar. Near Vardhaman Nagar, I know. Because my brother's in-laws live in Mulund. My uncle lives in Mulund East. So I know Mulund East very well. I don't know much about Mulund West, but my brother's in-laws live there. Khalid's in-laws live there.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Mostly in the Gujarat area. Not near Kalidas.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
My brother is also looking for a house there. Mulund is a hotspot for me. My brother lives in Mulund and my uncles also live in Mulund. Kamandpada and Neelamnagar. My uncle lives in front of the Neelamnagar fire station.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, Sagar and Kunal, why did I stop you? Okay, you will update your work on SDD, that's not a problem. The issue that is being raised is that, is certificate a one-time activity or is it continuously validated through the ID?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We will one time here so if I can share my screen. So this is the step specify your SAP CIDS administrator username and password and the location of the configuration file. So this is the step which they are talking about. So here if you see use an email address link to your SAP as user or universal as the username and password for the SAP S user other if you're for IDP or normal CIDS administrator username and password.



Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this is a one-time activity, right? So it's not that this user information is stored anywhere from an interface perspective for validation and evaluation, right?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Once this setup is done, then again we have to pass that. Might be a yearly once or twice. So that time again we have to pass but whoever is performing their ID should be available in the CID and they can pass their ID password.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
that it should be a system user or service user, right? But here, if you can see, it's an administrator user name.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
When does it become a system user, Kunal? When there should be a continuous validation of the ID and password between two things. If the password doesn't expire and the system user enters the password once, then on the basis of that ID, you are continuously validating and interfaces are happening, right? Now, this is not a continuous activity, this is a setup activity, It means it's a one-time thing.

 Sagar, is my understanding correct? Correct. Correct. Yes. So, if it is a one-time activity, it should not matter. Why should we do it with the system user? We should do it with the S-user. What is their problem? They don't have a password. See, they log in from SSO. Does SSO work on CIDS?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No. So, that's the problem. See, in normal companies, people work with single sign-on. Password.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Password.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
email that Kunal has sent to people. We mentioned that in that as well.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Basic authentication. Correct.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The second point in this is, how is the authentication mechanism configured between CIDS? Currently, it appears we will have configuration file and username and password. Currently, no other. We discussed and after that we said like it's a best practice. Anyone might Yeah. Okay.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So this is the second point. One more point. Tell me, what are the concerns, from an SDD perspective? I understood the second point.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
First is, is there CIDS and RFC?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And SAP, we are not talking about CIDS, we are talking about DSA and SAP, right? Yeah, basically that's what happened. And DSA basically it's, yeah. So DSA talks, right?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So here, both are hosted on the same cloud. So that's why... No, no.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Has two components, right?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
One is your DSA component, which is local, and your cloud component, which is CIDS, right? So here, the cloud component is not talking to S4 HANA. The local component, which is DSA, is talking to S4 HANA with RFC. Is this correct understanding?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Correct.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Right, right.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
And this is the concept we are having. Right. One is CIDS, and second one is CIDS agent.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Both are different, right? So here, we are using CIDS. We didn't talk about CIDS agent. That's why I got confused on question one.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
OK. We tried to explain and he also told us the standard architecture. Agreed. So basically it is between DS and S-Morana.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Right. Right. Yeah. Okay.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This was his reply. He said, your DS is already in safe zone, then why are you worried? And there is no other, means other approach is like basically middleware, which he said here.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We cannot go with middleware. The problem is that SAP needs to endorse this.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Whatever we are proposing, it is as per the best practice of industry.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Third point is like when we configure the CIDS and SAP.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there are two options. Username password and SNC. So there is no other option. So there is no other option.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So there is no other option. So there is no other option. So there is no other option.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there is no other option.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
So there is no other option.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So there is no other option. So there is no other option.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So So basically we are adding more connections. So basically it will just initiate the agent.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Basically, the agent is continuously polling.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
The agent replies to the polling request and the connection is set up. Yes. There is no data.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's just a metadata. If you have done MARA, then it's just a structure. Data doesn't come. We also tried to explain that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
There is no data. From a security perspective, it does not carry any tangible data which can be.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Yes. Okay.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think I'm clear. Only two requests are there. Both are for firewall. Firewall is the only request, right? There are no other requests, TM?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
We didn't raise any request for the service users and all.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It was direct. By the way, you sent me an email about the service users. Ask me. We have already created AdNoc's service users, right? Buruj's as well.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think Roshio told me that Buruj has been accessed. But I said we haven't received the ID. I checked with Reynaldo. He said he doesn't have it. I am not aware of the process.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You need to share the password. By the way, Buruj access has started now.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Let me show you.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
See here. Now it is getting open.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Guru Sandbox. Now we need to enter the password.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Let me find it out.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't have a lot of Nishant's chat, so I'll get it right away.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't have my name on the list, so I think he can tag me for that.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
For now, the way you're using it, I'll send you a personal chat.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. One second. Let me try to enter this one. Right. Welcome to 2 3 2. Yes, correct. So you pass what you have. Yes, I'm going to say. Yes, I'm perfect. I don't get bored. I don't get bored.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't get bored. I don't get bored. I don't get bored.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay. Yeah.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar, what's your name?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sagar's name? Sagar's name? Sagar's name? Sagar's name?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar's name? Sagar's name? Sagar's name? Sagar's name?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar's name?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sagar's name? Sagar's name?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar's name? Sagar's name?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sagar's name?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar's name?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Sagar's name? Sagar's name?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar's name?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
S If you think that Rinaldo's ID is getting locked somewhere, and you want to parallelize it, then you can use any of our IDs, there is no problem.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay, I'll give it to you. I think it's not a single sign-on, we have to pass the ID passport, so it's fine.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, you can use mine as well. Mine is not getting connected. It's not getting connected?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar, see if yours is getting connected. This is not a system.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, do it right now. Otherwise, if it is not happening, then we will have to take your advice. Give this snapshot to Sagar. I will give it to you.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
No, no, no, personally.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because the rest of the people will also be on this chat.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is Sagar's personal chat.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yeah. Yeah.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Yes. Yes. Boots to go.

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
It's one brought up in Mumbai.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yeah, I mean, so, uh, post that quick, we shifted to Mumbai. Okay. What time again?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
95 2001, 2001.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Okay. Because he doesn't have an office in India, right?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, he doesn't have an office in India.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
So, where do you work before that?

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
I work in a company called Bristol Cone in Mahindra.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, I have heard of Bristol Cone. Download this IPP file.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Which one, Rahul?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
This is the IBP software. Let's download it. Sagar, can you send me the plugin on KPMG? Kunal, do you have the plugin on KPMG? Let's take it on KPMG, Rahul.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
But how will it work? It's a plugin, Rahul. I installed it a long time ago. I directly raised my ticket in KPMG.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Did you have to raise your ticket in KPMG for the plugin?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, I raised my ticket initially when I joined KPMG one year back.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Because you had to do it from the KPMG side as well. Now that you are in testing, will you be able to do it?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
If we use AdNoc in VDI, then it is not an issue. But if we have to access it from outside, It can be accessed from outside as well.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
How are they accessing it? They are accessing it from their own system, right?

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
By inserting an ID Passport.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, they are not using Excel Editing, right? They are using Excel Editing, right?

Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Sagar, you are using Excel Editing, right? Yes, yes. I am not using, but yeah, IBP team is using that. That's what I am saying. Excel Editing... Yes, IBP works from outside.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
No, it will work from outside. But I am doubtful about Excel Editing.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
You can log in and see. No, no. Let's go. I think it's not working.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Schedule schedule schedule.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
What do you like, Thank you not to talk about it.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I feel like it is key. I don't know if you look at what I'm going to fill out connection. My IP had a white list from council. Mm hmm. So tomorrow at least. Activity. Rahul, yours is also not working? No, mine is also not working.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I have also checked.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Is it the issue of whitelist? Yes, it is dynamically allocated. So dynamically the IP has been allocated to you which is the whitelist.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I think so. The discussion was like this, the 4 digit, I will tell you in a minute, share my screen. Then we need to give the star. Now I don't know what they have done. 10.240, then we decided that dot star dot star means that everything should be covered. Because how was Sagar's IT? I remember Sagar's Rinaldo's 10.240.70.75 Now the trial series is going on, so where did the 70 come from I don't know who said this, but it came from the object.



Sagar Vora (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Rahul and Kunal, can I connect back for lunch? Yes, no problem. Kunal, I will ping you, I will update the sdd and I will just update. Sure, sure. Let's go through together.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Yes, yes. Okay.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Address 10.240.12.157.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Download.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
10.240.13.29 13.29, now it is 12.157.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
Right, so that's why the first 2 digit fix is 10.240, then another 2 digit it is variable in nature. Because Sagargan was .78, then earlier it was 13, now it has changed to 12. So this is more of a dynamic nature, so this has to be whitelisted. Or we need to fix the IP. Ok Rahul, then I will disconnect and then let us try to complete and close the SDD part in the SAP call. Is your travel plan finalized?

 Are you going on 27th?

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I don't have an approval for 27 either.

Kunal Sheth (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I want to talk to him first.

Rahul Patel (ADNOC Group D&CS):
I'll ask Roshio once. I'll also ask Roshio. Okay, let's go then.

UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:
Okay, thank you. So.
